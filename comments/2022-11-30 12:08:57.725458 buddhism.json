All of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas emanate aspects of Vajradhara. In a sense, realization is to become Vajradhara in supreme unity of the Trikaya. No meditation, one taste. Is that possibly what Siddhartha Gautama Buddha was saying in that quote? It can certainly be interpreted that way. \n\nSo in essence, the wholesome graffiti is just that. It\u2019s wholesome and if one person begins the path from it, takes refuge, or even just piques interest in the dharma, whether it\u2019s plural or singular is nothing comparatively.

Cutting through such attachments is more or less the goal in Buddhism. As an analogy, humans used to have to manually write messages to each other with ink and paper that had to be human-produced and delivered. All of that has been automated to where e.g. we're instantly & essentially cost-free\u2013ly communicating here on Reddit. We *could* instead still choose to deliver each other letters, though we're not. Sometimes handwritten messages *are* the preferable options, e.g. as special expressions of metta or when more recommended than electronic per right effort. These situations are less common though; generally people embrace the availability of online communication, would be annoyed at its becoming unavailable.\n\nThere's several industries, businesses, and services I refuse to engage with unless necessary because they require human labor that seems overdue for automation. In my view, it's like supporting the prevention or slowing down of sentient beings from attaining enlightenment; keeps them involved in worldly sa\u1e43s\u0101ric affairs; reminiscent of [yakkhas capturing humans for lifelong forced labor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LHhqPBHIMU).\n\nPeople often assume automation means \"we're taking that away from you\", but it's not like that, or shouldn't (doesn't have to) be like that. It's not automation that puts people into destitution because their employment is no longer mandatory (i.e. paid (viz. at all, as much)). IMO that's primarily our (socio)economic system and poor (cultural, individual) virtue.\n\nThe act of automating engages the pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (for Mah\u0101y\u0101na, up\u0101ya & j\u00f1\u0101na) & viriya [p\u0101ram\u012bs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81ramit%C4%81) when those involved hone the domain's theory.\n\nThat being said,What's the harm in automating the process?",

There are multiple ways to approach it.\n\nTwo Metta ways:\n\n *  Pay close attention to that hate you experience. Why is it pleasant to you? Contemplate the long term consequences of giving into hate. Is it a stable and wise companion in life? Can it turn on you? Does it help the mind let go of stress and dissatisfaction? What do you gain from carrying this in your mind? When you realize it as a cause of dukkha let it go and notice the mind be at peace.\n *  Start with fabricating loving-kindness towards yourself. \"May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I live with ease\". Once a strong feeling of loving-kindness is present move on to someone you hold dear, repeat the process, then move on to someone you have neutral feelings for, then someone you dislike, then all living beings. Whenever you feel that sensation of loving-kindness disappear, take a step back in the process and find it again, sit with it, and then return to the next step.\n\nUsing wisdom and understanding:\n\n *  Put yourself in their shoes - not in the sense of \"if I was in that situation\" rather, try to truly see the world from their point of view. Realise that you too would act just like them, if the conditions were right; confused, unskillful, tainted by the 3 poisons. Understand that while we may view those who offend as \"undeserving\" of our compassion and forgiveness, truly they are the ones that need it the most.\n *  Observe the teaching of Kamma. We have been the transgressor in exactly the same situation as they have across an infinite amount of lifetimes, yet here we sit, practicing for the good of all beings. If they don't deserve compassion and forgiveness, neither do we. We know we deserve compassion and forgiveness, so the same is true for them.\n\nI especially like the latter two, because personally they always result in me turning to face the path once more, each time with more conviction and gratitude. All these beings out there - plagued by the hindrances and unwholesome roots - completely sheltered from this path that leads to freedom.

From the comment I assume that you are still figuring out the early steps; I can give some guidelines on where to start, based on my practice with Theravada Buddhism, but it's not the only approach.\n\nI would recommend getting familiar with the 4 Noble Truths, the 3 Marks of Existence, the 5 Hindrances, and the Noble Eightfold Path - that was were I started. The Eightfold Path is divided into 3 areas of practice, which all support eachother;\n\nWisdom:\n\n *  Right View\n *  Right Intention\n\nVirtue:\n\n *  Right Speech\n *  Right Action\n *  Right Livelihood\n\nMeditation:\n\n *  Right Effort\n *  Right Mindfulness\n *  Right Concentration\n\nThe most important areas to begin with are Wisdom and Virtue.\n\nTo cultivate the right foundation for wisdom you have to intellectually grasp the basic teachings I highlighted earlier and how they connect to one another. You can accompany this practice with mindfulness meditation, either by being mindful of the body or mindfully contemplating the teachings themselves. In the beginning, the main intention behind studying these teachings is to learn which actions are virtuous and which ones are not. This also means that your main focus should be cultivating Right Virtue. There are very real consequences to living without virtue, and knowing right from wrong is only effective when the knowledge is acted upon. When done skilfully, many benefits will also arise.\n\nTo cultivate virtue you begin to develop Right Speech, Action, and Livelihood by practicing in accordance with those teachings continuously throughout your daily life (as well as possible). Stay compassionate towards yourself - we all make mistakes, what matters is learning from them and trying to do better. You can accompany it with Metta meditation, which develops empathy and loving-kindness in the mind.\n\nThe reasoning behind starting with Right Virtue is based on how our actions influence the mind. When we act unskillfully - such as by lying, or succumbing to hate and greed - we become burdened with the 5 Hindrances, and the mind becomes chaotic and unpredictable. By cultivating virtue the mind becomes still and unburdened, and this stillness allows us to see the subtle movements it makes when we sit down to meditate. So virtue gives rise to the conditions that are favorable for meditative practice.\n\nThis allows us to cultivate mindfulness, staying attentive and aware of the contents of the mind. We get distracted by these contents, notice, let go, and return to the meditation object - this is the cultivation of right mindfulness. This will happen less frequently until Right Concentration is established, and when the two are in balance one can notice the subtle movements of the mind.\n\nFrom here on we can experiment with cause and effect of thoughts and actions; \"this thought leads to this view, which leads to these actions, which lead to suffering\". Seeing this clearly cultivates wisdom, and letting go of that behaviour cultivates discernment. As these are cultivated they feed back into cultivating virtue, which feeds into cultivating concentration.\n\nThe time it takes to develop virtue is different for each person. For some it takes less than a year, for others up to 4 - maybe even more. But you don't need the grand insights or the deep meditation to see the benefits of putting in the effort until then; virtuous behaviour tends to reward us by itself.\n\nI don't have access to a teacher where I live, but I have found much help listening to Thanissaro Bikkhu's guided meditations and reading his presentations on the different topics. You can find him on YouTube, \"Thanissaro Bikkhu\", Spotify, \"Dhammatalks.org Evening Talks\", and on Dhammatalks.org, which has a \"For Beginners\" segment.\n\nA last tip I have would be - do not dismiss a teaching just because you don't like it. Compartmentalize the knowledge and revisit it when you're further on the path.",

My stress on truly existing self is something to be, you know, highlighted.  Because relatively speaking, there has to be a self.  There has to be, even as we begin teaching, I said, we should all have the right motivation: to get what? To get enlightenment.  There is a self, that is trying to shirk off samsara and awaken to the state of nirvana.  The analogy is like the \u2026 there are many Mahayana analogies and examples -- Like a rainbow, for instance, a certain amount of sunlight, moisture and angle of sunlight, rain and also the distance from you and the rainbow.  When all of these causes and conditions are together, there is something called rainbow :  Beautiful, intact. Colours and shapes are not chaotic.  It\u2019s all very ordered; dimensions with breadth, everything intact.  But clarity -- its colours, its vividness, its intact sort of order --  none of them makes the rainbow truly existing.  When the causes and conditions are there, it appears to be there.   That\u2019s how the Mahayana sees everything.\n\n\\~ Dongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche.  Parting from the Four Attachments.

Finding your true self is an act of love. Expressing it is an act of rebellion.\n2. A sign of growth is having more tolerance for discomfort. But it\u2019s also having less tolerance for bullshit.\n3. Who you are is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.\n4. Procrastination is the refusal or inability to be with difficult emotions.\n5. Desires that arise in agitation are more aligned with your ego. Desires that arise in stillness are more aligned with your soul.\n6. The moment before letting go is often when we grip the hardest.\n7. You don\u2019t find your ground by looking for stability. You find your ground by relaxing into instability.\n8. What you hate most in others is usually what you hate most in yourself.\n9. The biggest life hack is to become your own best friend. Everything is easier when you do.\n10. The more comfortable you become in your own skin, the less you need to manufacture the world around you for comfort.\n11. An interesting thing happens when you start to like yourself. You no longer need all the things you thought you needed to be happy.\n12. If you don\u2019t train your mind to appreciate what is good,  you\u2019ll continue to look for something better in the future, even when things are great.\n13. The belief that there is some future moment more worth our presence than the one we\u2019re in right now is why we miss our lives.\n14. There is no set of conditions that leads to lasting happiness. Lasting happiness doesn\u2019t come from conditions; it comes from learning to flow with conditions.\n15. Spend more time cultivating a mind that is not attached to material things than time spent accumulating them.\n16. Sometimes we need to get out of alignment with the rest of the world to get back into alignment with ourselves.\n17. Real confidence looks like humility. You no longer need to advertise your value because it comes from a place that does not require the validation of others.\n18. High pain tolerance is a double-edged sword. It\u2019s key for self-control, but can cause us to override the pain of being out of alignment.\n19. Negative thoughts will not manifest a negative life. But unconscious negative thoughts will.\n20. To feel more joy, open to your pain.\n21. Bullying yourself into enlightenment does not work. Befriending yourself is how you transcend yourself.\n22. Peak experiences are fun, but you always have to come back. Learning to appreciate ordinary moments is the key to a fulfilling life.\n23. Meditation is not about feeling good. It\u2019s about feeling what you\u2019re feeling with good awareness. Plot twist: Eventually that makes you feel good.\n24. If you are able to watch your mind think, it means who you are is bigger than your thoughts.\n25. Practicing stillness is not about privileging stillness over movement. It\u2019s about the CAPACITY to be still amidst your impulses. It\u2019s about choice.\n26. The issue is not that we get distracted. It's that we're so distracted by distractions we don't even know we're distracted.\n27. There are 3 layers to a moment: Your experience, your awareness of the experience, and your story about the experience. Be mindful of the story.\n28. Life is always happening in just one moment. That's all you're responsible for.\n29. Your mind doesn\u2019t wander. It moves toward what it finds most interesting. If you want to focus better, become more curious about what's in front of you.\n30. Life continues whether you\u2019re paying attention to it or not. I think that is why the passage of time is scary.\n31. You cannot practice non-attachment. You can only show your mind the suffering that attachment creates. When it sees this clearly, it will let go.\n32. Meditation can quickly become spiritualized suppression. Be careful not to use concentration to avoid what is uncomfortable.\n33. One of the deepest forms of peace we can experience is living in integrity. You can lie to other people about who you are, but you can\u2019t lie to your heart.\n34. Be careful not to let the noise of your mind overpower the whispers of your heart.\n35. Monks love to fart while they meditate. The wisdom of letting go expresses itself in many forms.\n36. You can't life-hack wisdom. Do the work.\n\n*\"Sayadaw U Pandita passed away in 2016. While I often resisted his style of teaching, I had the deepest respect for him. Through his teachings, my life changed in ways I can't describe; a sentiment echoed by thousands of others. I am forever grateful.\"*",

It's easier to observe and accept moment-to-moment change than to accept that there is nothing in the universe that exists independent of anything else. \n\nWestern philosophers like Ren\u00e9 Descartes understood the self as existing, because there had to be an origination to who was doing the thinking. Rationality, this thinking goes, is proof of the existence of the self. \"I think, therefore I am.\" However, I think most Buddhists wouldn't argue about the existence of the self either way, because ultimate reality (param\u0101rtha) has an ineffable quality that cannot be explained through language. As unenlightened beings, our senses can only perceive a provisional reality (sa\u1e41v\u1e5bti) governed by our own perspective and experience.

We don\u2019t yet know for sure that the human pineal gland produces DMT. \n\nThe idea that the pineal gland produces enough DMT to produce psychoactive effects came from the popular book \u201cDMT: The Spirit Molecule,\u201d written by clinical psychiatrist Rick Strassman in 2000. In rats, trace amounts of DMT have been detected in the pineal gland, but not yet in the human pineal gland. In the most recent study (I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to add links here, so I will instead give you the name of the article: \u201cBiosynthesis and Extracellular Concentrations of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in Mammalian Brain\u201d) on DMT in the pineal gland found that even after the pineal gland was removed, the rats were still able to produce DMT in other regions.\n\nBased on the studies done on rats, the pineal gland isn\u2019t capable of producing a high enough amount of DMT to elicit hallucinations or any significant psychoactive effects which alter perception. The pineal gland would need to be able to rapidly produce approximately 25mg of DMT to cause any \u201cpsychedelic\u201d effects. To put this number into perspective, the pineal gland produces only 30 MICROGRAMS of melatonin daily. DMT is also rapidly broken down by monoamine oxidase, so it couldn\u2019t naturally accumulate in your brain, assuming that MAO levels remain stable in the moments before death.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that the assumption is incorrect, as the similarities between descriptions of DMT trips and people describing near-death experiences are apparent, but I do think it\u2019s important to include scientific context. Science may not be perfect or able to prove everything, but it is still one of our most powerful tools in observing reality, so it\u2019s worth mentioning.

I had this misunderstanding too as a young Christian. When the word \"ta\u1e47h\u0101\" meaning craving/attachment/thirst is translated into English as simply \"desire,\" it loses an incredible amount of nuance. \n\nWhile yes, if you attained enlightenment you would probably not \"desire\" things in the colloquial English sense of the word, I think there is a lot more to the concept of craving/attachment/thirst than simply *wanting* something. Particularly when those something's wanted are fundamental needs for the body you inhabit. I don't think Buddhism asks us to give up our desire for food, water, shelter, air, freedom, or community in the pursuit of enlightenment. \n\nMaybe at some point the cessation of absolutely all wants is a goal, but in the here and now we have human bodies and they should be respected and treated well. I think that craving/attachment/thirst is referring to a desire for things above and beyond what we need to thrive as an embodied Buddha -- things such as prestige, respect, riches, fame, or power over others.\n\nAlso as someone pointed out the comic is not particularly funny because it does nothing interesting, just gives us exactly what we expect to see. It's fairly \"conservative\" humor in that way. Does not challenge expectations nor ask the viewer to see something in a novel way, which IMO is what good comedy does. In fact the \"joke\" in the comment is based on the point of view NOT making any sense to the reader. It's neither particularly good nor particularly skillful in my opinion.",

If you feel like reading it I'd appreciate that so so much lol but I 100% understand if you don't, I practically wrote a 3 page essay...)\n\nI kind of agree with that, although that's probably never gonna happen because the Chinese government has illegally occupied Tibet for almost 70 years now after invading and killing over a million Tibetans. Tenzin Gyatso hasn't even had the opportunity to be a leader since he had to flee the country when he was just a young boy, and the Chinese government still wants him dead. People who even get caught saying his name in Tibet now or who have any pictures of him, even children, they disappear and rarely do they ever come back. But Tibetan independence is an absolute must, as it is with most Chinese colonies. If that were to ever happen then I agree with you, Tibet should become a republic where the people lead themselves as a community. Even Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama himself has offered to give up his position as \"leader\" of Tibet if China's government eases off of Tibet. But that offer was also decades ago, it's not going to happen and when Tensin dies the Chinese government will choose their own \"Dalai Lama\" and it'll basically be a new dark ages level Catholic Church...\n\nAnd MAN, we're all so worked up about what Russia is doing to Ukraine, and rightfully so, but at the same time our world leaders are totally fine with China doing the same thing several times over at much larger scales because our rich business owners make a LOT of money off of them and their cheap labor since their workers are treated like drones, and they make even more off of us. \n\nAnd the US government is not innocent either, between war crimes, illegal blockades to intentionally starve nations like Cuba, the CIA staging over 75 coups staged many of which replacing democracies with dictatorships like what happened in Iran in the 50s, killing millions of Vietnamese civilians and ignoring requests for peace talks, everything we did with Native Americans like countless wars, treaties being violated, \"Indian Boarding Schools\", we have terrorized the middle east for decades, destablized them completely like Iran, we worked WITH Suddham Hussein until he stopped using US currency and that's when we went to war with him (he was a bad bad man, we never should've sided with him in the first place), the CIA literally armed and trained a group in the 80s which later went on to become Al Qaeda, and Osama Bin Laden himself was in that group, the government used one terrorist attack (9/11) to justify two more decades of terrorizing the middle east which has killed who knows how many civilians, the government employs just as many mercenaries as it does soldiers which is a huge war crime but \"they're Private Military Contractors not mercenaries so it's okay\", the media always lies and is ran by corporations with the same interest in mind and they pretend to be right wing left wing to divide the population so we never unite again like we did in the 60s before all of our leaders were assassinated, the FBI and CIA love to do coverups and if they aren't guilty for what happened to MLK and JFK then why are practically the entire filings on them redacted, and what about the death threat letter sent to MLK that the FBI themselves eventually admitted to sending him? What about Cointelpro? Mk Ultra where we don't even KNOW how bad that was because they burned almost all the documents?? Our founding fathers were monsters, we're lied to so much in school about our history, one example was, I was told George Washington had wooden teeth. No. He had 5 sets of dentures of slave teeth. SLAVE TEETH. And he paid a dentist personally to have the teeth of some of his slaves removed, wrote it in his business ledger himself. Thomas Jefferson was a p*do who also owned his own KIDS as slaves that he had with his original underage slave Sally Hemings.\n\nAnd to get back to the original topic, if we became enemies with China where would our smart phones and overpriced sneakers come from?? Then our elite and wealthy owners would have to actually pay workers a fair, livable wage and give them fair hours? And make a little less profit???? Oh jeez it'd be the end of the world for them to see their annual profit percentages go down a little. Heaven forbid we put people in front of profits...\n\nSorry for the rant. I've been frustrated about all of this and more for the last 3 years ever since my research project in senior year, and it's been driving me crazy. The rabbithole never ends. The only thing that brings me peace is accepting that things will never change and it's always been this way and it's just how the world works. It's crazy and wild and cruel but it's also beautiful and kind and loving and compassionate. There's a perfect balance but there's also always that burning itch that I can't resist scratching, to learn more and always speak out in the hopes that maybe if people become more aware that things WILL change. But we need to get off of this weird mentality of obsessing over what words people are saying and trying to look woke on Twitter or something and actually do some research. Then, MAYBE, things might change for the better.\n\nAnd if you want sources for any of these facts I stated please just ask which fact(s) you want the sources for and I will send you them.

The committee consisted of\u00a0Ven.\u00a0Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera\u00a0(chairman), Ven.\u00a0Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera,\u00a0Don Carolis Hewavitharana\u00a0(father of\u00a0Anagarika Dharmapala),\u00a0Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana\u00a0(maternal grandfather of Anagarika Dharmapala),\u00a0Charles A. de Silva,\u00a0Peter De Abrew, William De Abrew (father of Peter),\u00a0H. William Fernando,\u00a0N. S. Fernando\u00a0and\u00a0Carolis Pujitha Gunawardena\u00a0(secretary).[2]\nIt was first publicly hoisted on\u00a0Vesak\u00a0day, 28 May 1885[1]\u00a0at the Dipaduttamarama,\u00a0Kotahena, by Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera.[3]\u00a0This was the first Vesak public holiday under\u00a0British\u00a0rule.[3]\nColonel\u00a0Henry Steel Olcott, an American journalist, founder and first president of the\u00a0Theosophical Society, felt that its long streaming shape made it inconvenient for general use. He therefore suggested modifying it so that it was the size and shape of\u00a0national flags.[1]\nIn 1889, the modified flag was introduced to Japan by Anagarika Dharmapala and Olcott\u2014who presented it to\u00a0Emperor Meiji\u2014and subsequently to\u00a0Burma.[4]\nAt the 1950\u00a0World Fellowship of Buddhists, the flag of Buddhists was adopted as the International Buddhist Flag.[5]\n\n--\n\nYou can check the sources in the article if you want.",

Besides, the images of standing eight-handed Avalokiteshvara I have googled up so far are normally single-faced, and the top red head is definitely not of Amitabha but rather a form of Vajrayogini (male deities with five-gem-diadems also wear hair knots/have ***ushnishas)***. Avalokiteshvaras also often have uneven number of faces. To sum up, I think They are androgynous here.\n\nThe vahana, the creature mounted in the Thangka at the source page, is Garuda, a vahana of Vishnu, whose avatar Buddha is considered to be in some branches of Hinduism. What is more, Garuda is surrounded by Nagas, the two species being not exactly best friends forever. 'Opposites attract'? Yin-and-yang? Dunno--\n\nA very, very strange image indeed.\n\nAlso, They are green, which means They are semi-wrathful, and their posture and tools slightly resemble those of Vajrasamaya. Not to speak of Their main complexion, which is also exactly the same as that of Vajrasamaya's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ritualthanka.com/product/lokeshvara-thangka-popularly-known-as-avalokiteshvara-or-chenrezig-thangka-5279#mz-expanded-view-77744533702](https://www.ritualthanka.com/product/lokeshvara-thangka-popularly-known-as-avalokiteshvara-or-chenrezig-thangka-5279#mz-expanded-view-77744533702)",

There are two books in English that were written by great and knowledgeable painters. Gega lama, and Konchog lhadrepa. There is also a great guide by Robert Beer. David Jackson at the Rubin museum has several books that discuss history and historical paintings. There are also several guides to Nepali painting that introduce non Tibetan approaches to vajrayana painting styles. Good luck. Keep supporting Support dharma arts. There are many prints online that cost only slightly less than actual paintings by living masters. Buy the real thing if you can. Also check out the lotsawa project. There are descriptions of famous painting designs as prescribed by lamas there. As in, what was ordered from the painter by the lama which you can then see manifest in reality from museum collections. Really cool reading. Good luck.",

What's positive change? So many people talk so much about \"change\". \"We need change.\" \"Here\" is always a problem while \"there\" is utopia. Even in the modern first world, where we live better than anyone in history, there's no end of complaining. \"I have food, shelter, choices, medical care, and high speed Internet... but those assholes just put the price up! This sucks!\"\n\nThat, in itself, is aggression. That's life in samsara. Always dissatisfied.\n\nSo most religions have a general rule of first do no harm. Get the splinter out of your own eye before you try to take the log out of someone else's. Aim to help others as a bodhisattva. In the meantime, curtail klesha with discipline and meditation. Don't shit and vomit your neurosis all over the world. Don't make matters worse. Work with your own aggression. Then things might work out better... Even Hitler believed he was making \"positive change\". \n\nIn Buddhist view, the external world is regarded as your projection. That doesn't mean you can't be kind and promote fairness. But when you start deciding what the external world should look like, that's where it turns into aggression.\n\nOne of my favorite examples of that was the BLM protesters on the TV news. I don't remember where they were (maybe Portland, OR?), but it was footage of young white people, enraged and screaming at the top of their lungs at outdoor restaurant diners; getting in their faces with furious guilt trips about how those people MUST care about blacks. Yet there were no blacks in sight. The enraged protesters were white, probably upper-middle-class, trying to assuage their own guilt at being privileged in a culture with no tradition of noblesse oblige, or even any sense of social obligation at all. The protesters had no intention of sharing their trust funds with unfortunate minorities, but they were tearing mad that minorities don't also get trust funds, so that they wouldn't have to feel guilty about theirs. Do you really think those protesters were not destructive, just because they scream support for minorities?",

You use China and Japan as examples of nations with, shall we say, uniquely passive population, uninterested combating in the wicked and oppressive actions of their governments. But does this premise actually hold up? Is there really anything happening uniquely abusive about Chinese society that you couldn't find parallel for in, say, the United States of America? \n\nWe can say that the Chinese willingly accept lives that under constant surveillance, but then don't most Americans willingly carry around a device I'm their pockets that can track their every movement, listen in on their every conversation, and track every data point of the life? Jokes about NSA or FBI agents watching you sleep aren't exactly uncommon in the States. And private companies watching your every move isn't exactly that much better than if the government were doing it, especially since the government could just pay to get access to that information anyway.\n\nWe can talk about China's cruel treatment of the Uyghurs but then, there are still concentration camps on the America's southern border. Places were desperate people fleeing horrific situations are forced to live in absolute squalor for the merest hope of safety behind America's walls, often only to be rejected and thrown back to the very wolves the were fleeing. Make no mistake, people are dying in these camps. Disease runs rampant in such crowded and unsanitary conditions and that's to say nothing of the mistreatment of these migrants at the hands of a border patrol force who, often from the start, view them as a lesser form of humanity.\n\nWe can have a discussion about China's repression of the people of Hong Kong as if America's police force didn't respond to the protests in 2020 in armored military vehicles, firing canisters of expired tear gas and rubber bullets recklessly into the crowds. \n\nHow many Americans will die of exposure this year? How many people abroad will die to American bombs? How many American children will go hungry while it's supermarkets dump bleach on expired food, ensuring that it will go to waste?\n\nI don't say any of this to defend China's actions or to condemn America as some unique force of evil, but it seems rather silly and short-sighted attribute a population's tolerance of these actions to Buddhism when other nations, where Buddhism is not so dominant, are every bit as tolerant to much of the same human rights abuses. Perhaps, if you really wanted to know understand why Chinese or Japanese folk seem so permissive to the excesses of their governments, it may actually be quite beneficial to start by questioning why *you* think they are uniquely passive in first place.",

They just leave it at inaction. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised to find that there are portions of these eastern ideologies that *do* promote action in the world. But the way that these ideologies seem to be used or spread is only in promoting these rather isolated and indifferent aspects of the ideology.\n\nAt least the destructive individualism has caused *some* sort of resistance to being walked over.

The point was that even Hitler thought he was trying to help. He was trying to be a good person. So how are you so sure that your anger and activism is going to help, when everyone, always, thinks they're the good guy?\n\nYou think we're talking about different options for trying to change the world. The Buddhist approach is to work with your own mind. You don't take out your aggression on the world, creating \"my side\" and \"the evil side\". \n\nIf you work with your own mind then you can still also vote, avoid giving your toddler an iPhone, etc. But aggression is just aggression. \n\nWhat you're really saying is that religion is opiate for the masses and people need to get up off the cushion, hit the streets, fight for something-or-other. In Buddhist view that's considered a mistaken view. It's aggresssion, battling your own projections.\n\nIt sounds like you're not actually a Buddhist practitioner. You need to practice meditation and study the View in order to understand. It has nothing to do with withdrawal or indifference, navel-gazing or trying to stay in a peaceful cocoon. It's about cooling klesha to see clearly. It's about cultivating sanity. I vote. I'm careful about online privacy and security. I don't drink water out of plastic bottles that won't be recycled and I very rarely buy takeout food. I don't use social media. (Unless you count Reddit.) I try to be a considerate driver. I don't support scam businesses like AirBnB or Uber. I've never bought anything from Amazon. I don't normally use a cellphone. I don't invest in big business... Can you say the same? I also know how to fix my car, pay my bills, build my deck, do my taxes, cook my dinner with nutritious organic ingredients, and write my own software. That's all just part of relating to life sanely. Are you really, actively trying to support sane living, or are you just \"mad as hell and not going to take it anymore\"? I don't have a toddler. If I did they wouldn't be seeing a screen. And of course, if they ever opened a gmail account I'd have to kill them. :)  \n\nI don't see a contradiction. If you cultivate nonaggression then you manifest nonaggression. The world **is** your mind. You meditate, prctice ethical behavoir, pay attention and relate to it sanely. It's not either/or. The approach of either/or is coming from materialist/eternalist perspective.\n\nI do find, though, that some people are more politically oriented than others. Extroverts, generally, are more inclined to act on the world around them and see issues as happening there. Introverts are less likely to attend city council meetings, for example, regardless of whether or not they meditate. People have different strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you could run for Congress. That's not a problem for Buddhists. But your job as a rep or senator would need to be part of your Buddhist practice, not an exception to it. You come to each issue with mindfulness and nonaggression. Again, there's no contradiction there. Otherwise you're just another hothead yelling on the floor of Congress.",

I didn't respond to that because I don't think it's relevant to debate philosophical speculations. Your logic that you exist, despite changing, makes sense on the surface. What Buddhism is teaching is that attachment to confirming your existence is the root of suffering. I don't think it's possible to understand that without meditation practice. It's not a theory or belief. With meditation you see that process firsthand. The Buddhist view is experiential. \n\nBuddhism is saying experience is ungraspable as a thing. In our self-conscious fixation we panic. We want to confirm ourselves and our experience. But it can never be so. As a result we're constantly trying to reify experience through referential confirmation: \"I exist because I can see myself in the mirror.\" \"I think, therefore I am.\" \"My lover makes me feel so alive.\" Through passion, aggression and ignorance we try to constantly define \"me\" by defining relationships with other. \"I want this.\" \"I hate that.\" Those are very naive confirmations. We generate them non-stop, crafting an identity as a real existence relating to a real, external world. That's the outside world that you see. \"Life will be fine if I just get that job... if I just get laid... if we just get Russia out of Ukraine...\" It's always something.\n\nThere's no reason you should take my word for it. But in my experience, there's far more to spiritual path than opiate of the masses. It can certainly work that way. Religions are not without faults. But from the point of view of a meditator, it's actually the \"real world\" that's the opiate of the masses. Again, you have to meditate to understand that. It's not a philosophy. It's a description of the moment-to-moment, desperate grasping of discursive mind.\n\nWhen you see it that way it becomes clear that our passions and opinions are fueled not by rational analysis but by grasping. What if you really look at that? How do you know your universe is not a dream? There actually isn't any meta-context in which to confirm anything. What possible vantage point could there be to confirm self/other? It would have to be a vantage point outside of self/other. All we can say for sure is that cognition seems to be happening. So it's actually quite a tenable position to posit that the reification and the apparent meaning that our experience expresses are all created by mind, in the moment. What Buddha was saying is that it's actually possible to realize that, to realize the nature of experience far more deeply, and that he has a system to do that.",

But that, in itself, is an eternalist/materialist view: Does something exist or doesn't it?\n\nThat's the issue in the Zen riddle about the tree falling in the forest. Did it make a sound if no one was there to hear it? The eternalist says yes. The nihilist says no. But neither answer is correct. The point is to frustrate intellect until it gives up that model. Reality is ungraspable: \"Whatever is seen with the eyes is vividly unreal in emptiness, yet there is still form.\" That's also what's in the heart sutra: \"Form is emptiness. Emptiness itself is form.\" It explains that experience, the 5 skandhas, sense impressions, and so on, have no inherent existence, like the moon reflected in water.\n\nMeditation provides a way to experience that directly. By seeing discursive mind and calming its speed, experience can take on a slightly transparent quality. One experiences directly how mind is manufacturing apparent solidity.\n\nYou can see that even in daily experience. We just don't recognize it. Your lover breaks up with you. You're in a car accident. You lose your job... What happens? Reality loses it's solidity. The world seems surreal. You look at things but their meaning doesn't arise in your mind. Why? You wander around after you car accident. The crowd of people; the trees; the light; it's all so immediate, yet surreal. People talk about how they'll need to process their trauma or some such. \"I need a support group for car accident survivors so I can process this.\" But it's more direct than that. Discursive mind's storyline has been interrupted. So reality as we know it has dissolved. The next step is that you tell anyone who'll listen about your car accident or your firing or your lover who dumped you. \"I can't believe it! So unexpected!\" We're desperate to re-establish solidity. Once you've woven the event into your storyline, reality is re-asserted. You're now the person who had a car accident, or whatever. When people say, \"Jeesh! My house fell down! What a shock.\", you can say, \"Oh, tell me about it. I was in a car accident. I know from shock, let me tell you.\"\n\nWe flirt with that boundary of solidity all the time. If reality is too weak it's scary. If it's too solid we feel bored and trapped. Then we say, \"I need a vacation!\" So we take a vacation. We go to some tropical place and complain the whole time. \"We missed the breakfast buffet!\" \"What a nasty sunburn!\" \"Someone stole my beach towel.\" \"I don't like this mattress.\" But the real purpose of the vacation is to break habitual patterns of discursive mind. When we get home we feel great. \"My old coffee mug. I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time. I'm so refreshed.\"\n\nThe idea is that ego is like a desperate man, hanging in space, holding on for dear life. The only was to relax into the space is to let go of attachment to ego. There's a story about the 16th Karmapa who was dying of cancer in a hospital in Illinois, I think. People were amazed that he was always cheerful and it became a running joke that whenever he was asked about the pain, he'd say there was no pain. Facing death, his students were distraught. He reassured them: \"Nothing happens.\" Such a beautiful, powerful statement. He didn't say nothing happens after death. He just said nothing happens.",

Or rather, why is all seen as mind?

A world of non-mind that minds wander around. A world where mind interprets non-mind\n\nThe tree falls in the forest and vibrates what is next to it but no sound is heard because sound in a sensory relationship between an ear and the air.\n\nIk I used to the word independent earlier but I just lack vocabulary.

You can look around online for sources and maybe watch some videos. It's not important that there be a center nearby. If you find legitimate teachers and can get training, you can figure out the rest from there. \n\nThis is the practice I started with, but I'm not sure anyone's teaching it today:\n\nhttps://www.lionsroar.com/a-meditation-instruction-march-2012/\n\nWhen I first started meditating I got instruction from a student of Chogyam Trungpa. I had various insights. Nothing dramatic, but insights. At that point I'd been reading and searching for years. But I was astonished to realize that these insights never could have been found in books. I realized that I'd assumed wisdom could be understood as a concept -- that I only needed to find the right esoteric book. I think we all make such assumptions. Sometimes I think the path is mostly about finding the path. That's why meditation is so important. Understanding requires experience.\n\nI had a hard time meditating. I couldn't stand doing more than about 15 minutes at a time. To establish the discipline I signed up for a 1 month retreat. 9-10 hours per day of meditation with no talking. After that I felt established in practice. But what makes sense for you might be different. If you find a teacher you feel that you can study with, they'll likely have recomendations about books and practice. You could also just look for a place to do a group retreat, but there's no a lot happening these days, with COVID recently a problem.\n\nWatch out for lamas who just hand out Green Tara or mantras with no explanation, for self-appointed teachers, psychotherapists teaching meditation, etc. I'm sorry I can't provide better guidance, but anyone who tells you what's best is going to be telling you what they found best.\n\nAside from Tibetan, there are legitimate Zen teachers, but I don't know a lot about that. It's just not my style. The third major category is Theravada. That's a literal, fundamentalist school. Zen and Tibetan operate as lineages of realization. The teacher is critical. Theravada operates as a lineage of scripture: the officially approved sutras are the main thing.",

Over the years I've done solitary retreats in cabins that were cheap, or in trade for work.\n\nIn fact, when I first decided to try meditation I looked in an adult ed flyer. I was a poor hippie, living hand to mouth. The Hindu's wanted $2. The Buddhists were teaching for free. So I chose the Buddhists. :) I couldn't easily afford $2 and at the time I had no idea what the difference was between the two groups. I just assumed meditation was meditation. But the Buddhist instructor was also a student of Chogyam Trungpa, whose book I had just finished reading, so the choice was easy. Then my instructor got me the work-study deal so that I could do a retreat. It all just worked out.\n\nIf you do connect with Theravada, there's one branch that are followers of Goenka who offer a 10 day retreat. The cost is modest. I think you can actually do it without paying. Leeching free food and housing is probably not a good way to do a retreat, but you might be able to arrange something to pay your way.

I think that's a big challenge. I spent maybe 10 years just accepting things, figuring that I had nothing to lose and it would help me to be flexible. At some point I decided that I needed to trust my own judgement more, while still watching out for self-deception. But there's always that tension. You can't entirely trust either side. You have to depend on your intuition and your own rigorous honesty. A good teacher is going to sometimes make you feel uncomfortable, because their job is to wake you up.\n\nIf you trust blindly then a bad teacher will exploit you and a good teacher will probably not bother with you. If you only trust yourself then you'll never benefit from the teacher. If you depend on  popular opinion to assess teachers then you'll be blind to your own intuition. There are no gurantees. You have to be willing to be challenged and not look for safe ground. In a way I suppose that's the whole path.\n\nRecently there's been a lot of talk about sex scandals and the like. People want to be able to trust teachers to coddle them like a psychotherapist. Any hint of something more gritty results in teachers being \"cancelled\". At the rate it's going, there won't be any teachers left who aren't cancelled, except maybe someone like a castrated Mr. Rogers who won't accept money, never drinks, and unfailingly says nice things. :)\n\nYou might find it helpful to meet some teachers, to get a sense of what realization really means. As for books, the most affecting for me was Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. It provides an outline of the path to enlightenment in a very earthy, experiential way. I think you can get a free copy, maybe at archive.org. But you have to remember that any Dharma book is a guide to meditation experience. You need both.",

It draws heavy inspiration from Tibetan depictions of his Amitayus aspect with a more Chinese twang if that makes sense. I made his skin a reddish pink, both to pay homage to Tibetan depictions of him and to symbolize the blend of orange, red, and pink, colors typically associated with the sunset and thus alluding to the fact that his Pure Land is located in the west. I made his clothes red both to pay homage to multiple chinese artworks giving him red clothes, and because red in general is a very important color in Chinese culture in general. I also adorned him with Imperial Jade, the highest quality of Jade, to symbolize his purity and spirituality, and yet another nod to Chinese culture as a whole. And, though it may be controversial, all of us here know the true meaning of the Swastika outside of its stolen misuse, so I added one to his chest, which is another popular symbol often seen on Amitabha Buddha\u2019s chest in Chinese art. Finally, I have him atop a lotus flower like Almost all depictions of any Buddha/Bodhisattva and added chinese painting style clouds in the background, once again, painting him as the infinite light setting in the west.

When I hear stuff like this, my gut reaction is \"Oh great, now I have to defend Buddhism to a bunch of people who lump all religion in the same basket and will look at this as representative of corruption in all organized religion\"...\n\nAnd then I step back and think \"Why do I feel a need to defend anything?\" I am a buddhist. Buddhism isn't me. I identify as a buddhist, but it's not healthy to get into this tribal defensive mind state. And it's good to remember that hero and idolizing anyone, isn't why I got into Buddhism.\n\nAnd sometimes I get frustrated by the lack of understanding of Buddhism from outsiders. And then I ask myself \"Why does someone else's lack of understanding frustrate me?\" Why do I feel a need for people to \"understand this thing I care about\"? \n\nBasically, when I hear stories like this, I think of the concept of \"being thankful to enemies, they give you the best opportunities for practice\". I view these monks as fake buddhists and as enemies, but they're not, I'm frustrated because they have as much claim to the name buddhist as I do. They're just not good buddhists. And I have to face that there are \"not good\" buddhists out there, and unwind my own biases as to what I expect from people I have no responsibility for.\n\nAnd I also have to remember... Well, I'm not a good buddhist either a lot of the time. Because of my culture I view some things as a lot less taboo than others. I know I shouldn't swear or speak untruths, but I do all the time. If I were a monk I'd be committing a taboo just as heavy as substance use. So who am I to judge? Why do I feel a need to judge. Why do I think I'm a better buddhist than these monks?

But since  my home is Thailand, it wasn\u2019t so easy to fly back. All that extra time made me reflect on myself, I started journaling and did online therapy. Then I thought I should try meditation and mindfulness (still with a scientific view on it)\u2026 And BAM one day I started tripping while meditating. I didn\u2019t realize I was meditating for over 2 hours and I started seeing a bunch of crazy things haha. It got kind of intense so I opened my eyes, but the trip still continued !!\n\nMy initial reaction was that I was having a psychosis because I didn\u2019t know about psychedelics / meditation yet at the time. I almost called the ambulance actually lol, but because it was so beautiful and I felt so at peace , I didn\u2019t call them and just kind of let it go away on it\u2019s own. \n\nI spent about a week researching what happened. And nothing \u201cscientific\u201d could explain it. Eventually I texted a mutual friend who I knew was into meditation, and after describing what I saw in my trip to him, he told me it sounded like smth you would see on DMT. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know what DMT was , and I didn\u2019t understand how I could \u201ctrip\u201d without taking drugs. I was honestly so confused and scared at the time.\n\nBut anyway after lots of reading, researching , and meditating, I decided to travel to Peru a few months later to do Ayahuasca, and it confirmed what I saw during my meditation. Still blows my mind to this day that 1 meditation session completely changed my worldview and led me to the Peruvian Jungle . \n\nBut for that I\u2019m forever grateful :) ! \n(Btw I\u2019m not promoting psychedelics or anything, just saying that it worked for me on my journey.

I think we have to be extremely careful when we insist that a teacher or temple is 100% required, even if it is true in some if not all traditions.

                "content": "Maybe as a few points of reflection:\n\nSomehow, we often have the idea that we shouldn't feel bad over loss, illness, death and so on. We want to stop grieving. We want to *cope.* I'd say, however, that this suffering over suffering is entirely reasonable. These feelings are not *wrong.* We have lost something we loved. We are experiencing pain where didn't use to feel pain. How can we expect ourselves, as we are, to cope with that? This is not how wanted things to go at all!\n\nBut what our frustration is *about*, our experiences of pain and loss, aren't \"wrong\" either. Whatever we feel we are and have, our bodies, our experiences, all of it: it is unstable. To go on the way we are used to them requires many, many conditions, almost all of them outside of our control. Conditions shift, and our experiences follow. Each moment teeters on the edge between past and future, and having gone... is gone. No matter how much we love something, sooner or later, it will be lost. No matter how much we hate something, when it happens, it happens. There is happiness and there is pain. Both are naturally occurring flavors of our lives. \n\nSo again: how can we expect ourselves, as we are, to cope?\n\nWe don't accept this as our lives, so we suffer. We suffer when pain comes. We suffer when happiness goes. We suffer when our hopes remain unfulfilled. We suffer when our fears come true. In fact, if we look at it like that, it seems that this \"not accepting our lives\" is pre-loading whatever we may experience, whether that be happiness or pain, with something else: suffering, frustration, dissatisfaction, *duhkha,* the subtle but unmistakable *fuck-this-ness* of each subsequent one of our experiences. \n\nAs we are, holding on to ideas of how things *should be*, we will never be able to cope. We can't cope with pain and we can't cope with happiness. Our main emotional investment is in this idea of what we feel we should or could be. What we *are*, in all our naturally occurring happiness and pain, is always, more or less visibly, an annoyance. \n\nWe could, however, let go. We could let be. We could be with our lives as they unfold naturally. When happiness comes, we could be with the happiness, not fretting over the certainty that it will not last. When pain comes, we could be with the pain, acknowledging not only *it*, but also our frustration with the fact that we're in pain. We could let our lives be and be our lives, without criticizing our experiences, but without solidifying them either. After all, nothing is solid. Everything, both the things we experience and our experiences themselves, are in constant flux, without anything ever settling down anywhere. Our clinging and aversion are as exhausting as they are because they are literally like yelling at a river to stop flowing. \n\nHappiness comes. Happiness goes. Pain comes. Pain goes. Morning, evening. Spring, winter. Birth, death. This experience, that experience. And every time the next thing happens. There is no such thing as a permanent injury, from that perspective. Every thing that happens is a door that's wide open.\n\nAccepting that doesn't mean we have to *like* all of it. Like and dislike are just more fleeting experiences that we can allow to come and go, without either denying them or pinning them down to the styrofoam like a rare butterfy. Paraphrasing one teacher (not a Buddhist, but it is a good phrase): we can stand naked in the wind and rain of life. It isn't always fun, but it doesn't have to be frustrating. \n\nOnly some thoughts, of course. I'm sorry your body got injured. Good luck!",

The healing process has been quite intense and in many ways is still ongoing, but through it I have discovered new things that bring me joy in life. I started doing yoga which helps the pain and I rediscovered mindfulness to try and focus my thoughts on being more positive. I've also given up alot of my old bad habits since I noticed it was causing negative sensory effects where I got injured. Stopped drinking and smoking and instead I'm now reading a lot more to pass the time and distract myself. \n\nI'm not saying this is the answer to your problems but despite the ongoing difficulties with my injury I have discovered a lot of new things in life I wasn't aware of before. I'm now trying new things a lot more as part of this journey to try and heal and every now and then i'm really enjoying finding these new experiences. I hope that you can atleast find a little bit of inspiration out of this to start your own healing journey and hopefully find some small undiscovered new pleasures from it along the way.

What is without self, that is not mine, that I am not, that is not my self. Thus should it be seen by perfect wisdom (*sammappa~n~naaya*) as it really is. Who sees by perfect wisdom, as it really is, his mind, not grasping, is detached from taints; he is liberated.\n>\n>  [Aniccasutta](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.45/en/sujato?layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) | SN 22.45\n\nThe Buddha has long advised us to regard the body as impermanent; that is to say that it is subject to change. Often that change is slow, sometimes it is sudden. Even so, change is unavoidable because its nature is change.\n\nHe identifies that whatever is impermanent is unsatisfactory (*dukkha*). It is uncontrollable, unrealiable - it can't ever be satisfying.\n\nMost of us have minds which take this for granted; a lot of us may accept this as an intellectual truth, an abstract notion of something *out there* that's true for other people ... but then it happens to us and it becomes real, and then we're left to realize there's this gap between what can be known intellectually and what can be known experientially. \n\nThat gap can really suck.\n\nSo what's someone to do about it?\n\nThree things, broadly speaking:\n\n1. **Morality;** Keep the [5 Lay Precepts](https://tricycle.org/magazine/the-five-precepts/). This lays the ground work for never regretting any action of body, speech, or mind. Having no regret, you can feel pretty good about that.\n2. **Concentration:** Pain management strategies always involve a mindfulness practice; do not avoid this. The mind wants to run away from the pain and discomfort, and that rejection of the experience actually makes your suffering *worse*. It's counter-intuitive, but when you pay more attention to it, the pain softens. It also helps to clarify your perceptions of the pain so that you can see it's not something that's happening *to* you, it's just something that's *happening.*\n3. **Wisdom:** Become familiar with what the Buddha taught with regards to impermanence, not-self, and unsatisfactoriness - the *Three Marks of Existence*.\n\nFinally, be sure to look into and even take up an understanding and practice of [Metta Bhavana](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/buddharakkhita/wheel365.html). This is for your own emotional well-being, which is critical at this time and going forward. When we are in pain, we have a tendency to close our hearts so we can focus inward and we neglect others. This causes us to suffer even more, especially when this behavior drives others away and becomes a self-perpetuating cycle.",

Then you're going to do it again, and eventually you'll realize that you haven't thought about it.\"\n\nThis is just to say it will suck now, but eventually over time it becomes just something in your life and you'll adapt and that will just be your new reality. Once you accept that however long it takes you move on. \n\n\nFor right now feel what you're feeling, grieve, cry, do whatever. Only after some time it'll get better. My advice from my own situation.",

There is no CT scan or EEG that will demonstrate the existence of these precise categories.\n\nBetter to think of it almost in philosophical terms, like Jung or similar, but with more rigorous attempts to map out and categorize experience.

All phenomena are unstable, impermanent, always in flux. Our experiences change, and our ideas actually also change. Continuous change is the nature of the world.\n\nContinuous change is what *we* actually are.\n\nAs long as we view ourselves and the world through the lense of craving, we'll always feel cheated, both by suffering *and* happiness. But it's not actually our experiences that cheat us. We're cheated by out intuition that we *should*, or *need to* get what we want, that our experiences *should* fit this or that picture we hold dear.\n\nThat way, as Shantideva says, *while happiness is all we want, we chase it away as if it was a hated enemy.*\n\nAnd in fact, it's all just in the mind. All our experiences are just in the mind. The ideas we sign our wellbeing over to are just in the mind. All this suffering, all this effort, all this pain, we go through for the sake of our minds.\n\nSo where is that mind? Where is that *me* that all these experiences happen to? Who is there who I should go through all of that trouble to to keep satisfied? Where among all these experiences, thoughts, feelings, memories, sensory impressions, is that *me* for who's sake I struggle every effing day?\n\nIsn't everything I *think* is me just another experience? Just another thought, just another *idea*, that comes about through causes and conditions, just another occurrence, like the sound of a car passing be?\n\nHave we lived out whole life in awe of a ghost that turns out to be no more than a shadow on a coat rack? Was all that upset we went through like someone seeing a snake slithering behind the toilet bowl that on closer inspection turns out to be a piece of string?\n\nTrying to satisfy and save guard a *me* that slips away every moment, like all ideas and experiences do, it's no wonder that we feel so hopeless and exhausted.\n\nSo where is that *me*? And what, when I can't find it?\n\nAs said, just as some reflections. I believe questions often help us much more than answers. Looking for answers might be just another of those elusive, fruitless ghost hunts. But we're here right now, in the bright sunshine and the pelting rain of present knowing. And maybe there's actually no particularly good reason to stay upset with pageantry of ghosts and snakes and ropes and happinesses and pains and *me*s. It may even be sort of delightful, if we don't try to hold on to it. It doesn't prove anything, of course. Reality doesn't have to.\n\nSo that's a \"one trick\",\u00a0I suppose. We *can* just drop our ideas. Of course, we're creatures of habit, so it's likely that we're going to have to drop them over and over again for a good long while until we've sort of unlearned the habit. Doable though!\n\nAnyway, be well. ^((minor edits))",

You have to end the negative causes and give rise to the good ones.\n\nThe cure for myriad negative states is unconditional wisdom-compassion (*bodhicitta*).\n\n* Stress comes from self-centered thinking. The more you are wrapped up in \"I, my, me\", the more suffering you have.\n\n* Relief comes when the \"I, my, me\" thinking settles and dissolves.\n\n* During meditation, the self-thought settles and wisdom-compassion is naturally revealed. Outside of meditation,  the practitioner courageously practices wisdom-compassion in relationship with others, to move beyond the stressful and petty self-thought.\n\n These are two categories of training in Buddhism: *Samadhi*, or meditative, and *\u015aila*, or discipline in relationship (also known as ethical discipline). The third category is *Praj\u00f1a*, wisdom, which includes both experienced insight and study with proper teachers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>*Buddha promised liberation from suffering, yet there are no people claiming to be enlightened besides himself that are not clearly cult leaders.*\n\nYou are making overblown, fantasized claims. Realize that your self-made stories are a cornerstone of your depressive patterns.\n\nThere are *countless* wonderful teachers in the world who have attained various levels of enlightenment. They just don't toot their own horns: they typically don't strut around announcing their enlightenment (though some authentic teachers may, with compassionate intent, do so for the sake of those who don't have the capacity to discern a good teacher for themselves).\n\nIf you are not meeting authentic teachers, you should realize that this is also a result of your own karma -- the aspect that's commonly known as lack of 'merit': **you yourself haven't established the causes for meeting and appreciating excellent teachers; and you yourself have established the causes for mistrusting, ignoring, rejecting, misconstruing, and abandoning Dharma.** Since you established the causes, you experience the results. This is clear.\n\nYou clearly have a great deal of positive Dharmic karma, because you have a human body and faculties and an interest in Dharma; but the negative karma is also there and needs to be addressed if you hope to find a proper teacher and thereby progress along the Path of liberation.\n\nImagining you can do it yourself without an authentic teacher is another example of the obscuring karma you make, as well as its result.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBe aware that inner peace is not caused. You don't 'get' it from somewhere else. Your own innate nature is already peace, *if you don't obscure it*.\n\nThis is like the sky that is always there, pure, clear, stable, and open. It is never marked or harmed by the birds that fly through it or the things that grow up into it.\n\nWhen clouds come, we may think from our perspective that the sky is not there any more; but that is a mistaken view. The sky is still there, open, accepting of clouds, accepting of no-clouds. Its own nature is never changed. The clouds just cover it up *from where we stand*.\n\nSo a larger part of the Path has to do with removing the clouds that obscure your true peaceful nature. Your true nature itself never changes. Sky-like peace is closest to you: it's what you really are; but you need to stop doing the things that block it from being expressed. For instance, you need to become aware of the negative effects of stories you make.\n\nIf, in a moment, you *put everything down* -- all thinking, making, holding, wanting, avoiding, manipulating -- then in that moment, your true peaceful nature is revealed. But do you trust that? Because you have doubt and because you have negative patterns that obscure your true nature, and that you often don't even know exist, *you need a proper teacher and a course of training*.\n\nBut for now, you can consider *putting it all down*. Can you do that? Don't imagine that it will look or feel the way you expect it to. It looks and feels like this moment, as-it-is. Your own true nature is not separate from the world moment as-it-is, though it is also not marked or moved by the world either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>*But just being sure that nothing is permanent and nothing is sure just doesn't cut it.*\n\nThe point is that you are not sure. Currently it's just an idea, not a directly experienced realization that penetrates to your bones.\n\nYou correctly point out the all-important difference between *thinking* and *attaining*. **All the good ideas in the world can't help you. You have to have the awakening experience yourself.** \n\nThere is no other way, there is no escape, there is no trick. You have to do what it takes to wake up to reality. \n\nTherefore, you need to gather the conditions for waking up. The most important, most influential of these is finding a proper teacher.\n\nEgo always wants to be the boss, regardless of how incompetent it is, so it can maintain *status quo* -- so it can keep things *always the same*. It will resist the prospect of change. It will mistrust anything that might transform you and make you into someone new and unpredictable.\n\nEgo prefers its familiar suffering to anything unfamiliar and new. So ego never has a Springtime, never has a renewing, refreshing movement. This is important to realize: your sense of what's safe and comfortable may be blocking you from becoming what you are meant to be: complete, fresh, and at peace.\n\nTherefore the ego and its ingrained patterns of arrogance and doubt will resist the idea of learning with a teacher. But if you have wisdom you will see that this blocks your chance to awaken and move beyond those patterns that are not serving you.",

                "content": "Our emotions are a response to how we are perceiving the world. In fact, we believe we see the world, but in reality, we only have interpretations. One way they express this in Buddhism is as things are empty of qualities.\n\nFor example, if two friends are hiking and suddenly rains, one may think \u201cthis is great, the land is dry, and we needed rain. The rain is great\u201d and then feel happy. The other friend may think \u201coh no! My shoes aren't waterproof. This rain sucks\u201d and he may feel frustrated. There\u2019s nothing inherently bad or good in the rain. The emotions result from how they perceived the rain.\n\nOur emotions are thus warning signs that point directly to our own perception/interpretation. They are telling you, you\u2019re out of sync with how reality works.\n\nSometimes, when we\u2019re depressed, two things go together: strong attachment to our views and overtly self concern without self love.\n\nOne of your views is \u201cmy life sucks too much\u201d. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not true, just look at it. Question it.\n\nMeditation is the art of seeing. When we are an emotion, we look at it. We do this at the moment we feel it, not after, unless is too strong in which case we wait to let it decrease. The images, thoughts, and constructs that go with it are what we pay attention to. We want to look at the complete picture. By looking, one can eventually see what elements are false or not accurate, and also what things we can change and which ones we cannot. These are the scaffolding of the feeling (in this case, depression) structure. Once some (even one) are seen as not accurate the structure falls.\n\nSome of these elements were formed when we were kids and they are hidden from our consciousness. In this case, it can happen that we feel unable to see the complete structure and we just have what it feels as an automated, spontaneous feeling. Here we train to just letting it pass.\n\nAlso, apart from practicing no attachment to our views, we practice self love. Learn to love yourself as if you were your own kid.

I suggest you investigate your own depression and see how it functions. You are unhappy. Have you questioned how that\u2019s even possible? What is unhappiness? What is misery? What is depression? How do these things work? Find out how they work. Reverse engineer them, and then engineer a solution of your own. What does unhappiness taste like, so to speak? Where does it come from? Are you causing it by thinking certain thoughts? Or is it an inherent flavor of your mind? Can you change the flavor of your mind?\n\nOne problem with depression is that it plays tricks on you. One trick is it makes everything seem hopeless. It hyper focuses on the negative possibilities and ignores the positives. I have strong belief in the power of Buddhism when you see the teachings clearly, but seeing them clearly is a feat of its own, hard to do when your lenses are fogged with depression\n\nInvestigate your mind and find out how it works.

I've been going through strong boughts of depression since middle school, and that combined with ADHD that went undiagnosed until about a year ago, I've felt like I've been clawing for a hold on life for forever.\n\nThat said, there are a couple ideas I've learned about that have been helping me, even managing to persist through my phases of depression (which, at least for me, is significant. Normally, my hope and faith in whatever practice I was trying dissipates after a downspin). They certainly haven't solved anything, but they've at least made certain things easier.\n\n- Hell is just another one of the Ten Worlds. It's a natural state of being, and there's no shame in experiencing it. By recognizing that it's with you, you can also regain some executive control and judgement that it may have otherwise stolen from you. It's not you, it's a state that you're apart of, and that might be coloring your experiences and choices that day, memories of the past, perceptions of yourself. Thinking this way can help you maintain control when you're feeling low, and help keep your affairs from crashing too. For example, it can help me finish my assignments for the next day (I'm a student) when all I might feel like doing is curling up and dwelling on all my past shortcomings. Then, when things are on the upturn, I'm still in an okay place with everything, and don't need to do damage control. I can make some progress.\n\n- A book I've just started reading makes a point about a so-called \"observed you\" and a \"seeing you\", with the idea that there's a you that experiences all that the world has to offer -- despair, joy, hunger, temperature, pain -- and a you that sees yourself in a sort of 3rd person perspective, that has all sorts of hopes and dreams for you, that knows what you want to be, and that can observe the phenomenon happening to you more objectively. This idea can also be helpful when you're feeling low -- it's not that the feelings aren't strong and real, but they become a bit more removed from you, which allows you to try to make choices that are in alignment with your core beliefs/values/goals depsite them.\n\n- Finally, allowing compassion to yourself too. A lot of the texts I've read emphasize cultivation of yourself for the benefit of those around you and your society, and while there's truth in how that in itself can bring one peace and satisfaction, thinking of yourself as another person who can be helped this way can be relieving. Even things have gone wrong in the past, and things may still go wrong in the future, you still inherently have the potential to find peace and become who you want to be to both in relation to others and yourself. Behaving according to what you yourself see as \"what's right\" can bring improve your life too.\n\nI don't know if this helps, and I'm still quite new to the practice, but between this and the other comments here, I hope something resonates and helps you!",

But little by little I developed the ability to experience these feelings without panicking or rushing to stop it.\n\nIt took at least a couple of years, but eventually I found that even real-world problems (not having rent, a death in the family, a friend relapsing) had much less power over me. Sure, it's not always comfortable to let those things hit me full force, but when I do I find that I don't really consider it \"suffering\". And because I'm not consumed by resisting whatever it is I don't like, I find myself better able to deal with situations carefully.\n\nI'm not saying this is the way other people should handle it, most people think I'm nuts and I don't even know if I explain it adequately.

By identifying the root causes of our suffering and developing and using that awareness with rational thinking we can begin to understand our own mental process that results in suffering, or (hopefully) the cessation of suffering. On an individual basis. There are many qualified teachers, which can be chosen on the basis of their own emotional health, compassion and wisdom. \n\nNot to be trite, but if you have access to Netflix you might watch \"From Stress to Happiness\". It's a nice movie. At around the 46:00 minute mark, Matthieu Ricard (a monk and scientist) gives his view of \"life\" which is profound for it's simplicity and directness. Likewise, the catalogue of Venerable Robina Courtin's efforts as an educator have resonated with me, again for their utter lack of pretension and understandability. A brief clip on karma:  \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/ClY2gcGoUeS/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=\n\n\nShe (a Buddhist nun) has been prolific, but most helpful have been many YouTube \"lessons\". \nParticularly helpful: her exposition \"be your own therapist\". (And many, many more.) Her teaching schedule can be found on her website: https://robinacourtin.com/home/\n\nAlso, James Low is a psychologist and teacher who offer insightful and helpful (to me) content at: https://simplybeing.co.uk/about-james-low-2/\nThe Dalai Lama has a website and YouTube channel. His book, \"How to See Yourself as You Really Are\" helped me do exactly that. A good companion to that is Michael Pollan's \"How to Change Your Mind\".\n\nThese are a few teachers that have literally changed my life. More accurately, they helped me come to understand and accommodate my own issues. They taught me how to help myself. Through informed reason and by my own efforts. In ways that years of reading and meditating had not. My point is that you need to find a teacher who can help YOU learn how to understand YOUR mind. Unlike theistic faiths, there is no creator or superior being that is going to answer your prayers. Which is what appealed to me. As hard as it might be, I was empowered by the concept that my happiness and potential were entirely within my capacity... for self awareness, self-esteem and healing. \n\nIn any case, please don't give up on seeking truth, empowerment and peace within.",

In Buddhist philosophy, a person is an imputation -- a label applied to a constantly changing collection of aggregates, all of which are empty of a separate self-identity, individually and in combination.\n\nWhat is **despicable**? A notion, a concept. Another imputation. A description of personality and behavior, both of which are, as discussed, empty.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, you can have compassion for despicable people.\n\n**At the same time, please note:** Having compassion for despicable people, by viewing them from the perspective of ultimate truth, does NOT equate to approving of, or excusing, such people, from the perspective of conventional truth. Conventional truth still holds profound meaning for the experience and suffering of sentient beings, and it is still conventionally right to condemn white supremacy, Naziism, genocide, authoritarianism, and so forth. It is just important that we do so with right understanding of the underlying causes and conditions that give rise to such pheneomena so that we may better prevent them from arising. Sometimes, conventional punishment or incapacitation may very well be necessary. But the touchstone in all instances is effectiveness for ending suffering, not necessarily moral condemnation in the conventional sense.\n\nAnd I say this as a person of Jewish heritage and as a person who was absolutely horrified by recent politics in the United States.

Physical verbal mental emotional sexual. Which trauma leaves a lasting impact on victim and which does not, is hard to pinpoint. Why do some people externalize their trauma and why do some internalize, is hard to pinpoint. I have seen traumatized people crying sulking feeling envious worthless inside but not take out on others. And I have seen spoiled people insulting others, bullying, putting them down to soothe their jealousy, worthlessness and to either feel better about themselves or make others feel bad about themselves - both work. \n\nFirstly, keep boundaries. No love and compassion for abusers. I have done it in past thinking we are all humans so why not. But the abusive people seriously drain your emotional energy. They confuse the hell out of you so much that uou doubt your judgment and perception. They will take your submissivness as foolishness. But it is not possible to assert boundaries alway because I have seen abusers going out of their way to lure their target back in. They dont let go of their asset, supply, validation source easily. Perhaps this is why a lot of victims dont realize they have been abused until it is too late because the abuser kept them luring back in with emotional needs and pretension. \n\nSecondly, depth psychology has taught me that all of us are hurt and have things we do not like in ourselves. This does not mean to go around hurting others because you dont like it in yourself. There is no excuse for such behaviour. Buddhists are not pure loving fountain of love. They have massive ugly shadows that they hide behind lessons and lectures. I dont trust anyone who pretends to be wise, not even myself. It is all just a filter to hide the real monster inside. \n\nThirdly, Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump are not product of one reason but many reasons ranging from biology psychology destiny karma environment and much more that we are not yet aware of. Worrying about them is so useless. This is lesson to myself too because i also think too much about bad people in the world. Just accept they are bad and stay indifferent.

Some have more energy left to help others and are able and willing to stick around for longer. Most if not all of them will eventually be done and end the cycle of rebirth. \n\n...

They also have very different definitions for the same words. Ergo, Teravada looks at Buddahood as a very specific and special thing.

                "content": "Is there many sexist things taught within the Pali Canon and Agama Canon? Hell yes.\n\nHowever are all these sexist things authentic to the Buddha? Probably not ( though some clearly are )\n\nThe Garudhamma as you speak of is likely a later insertion. The reason it is likely a later insertion is its origin story and rules. The garudhamma rules almost assumes one is already a nun!! Read it carefully, it overlaps with the nun vinaya and with later rules. This makes ZERO sense, unless you assume it is a later addition. \n\nAlso it assumes that Ananda was old enough to intercede with the Buddha. The problem is that Ananda was likely younger than the Buddha. The reason is we know within the Mahaparanirvana Sutta Ananda was called youngling, or one whose hair was not even gray ( dependent upon which version you read in the Agama or Pali ). The Buddha was eighty when He died. If Ananda was 80, surely he could not have no gray hair. \n\nAlso this overcomes the absurdity that Ananda died at 120 years of age. EVEN with good modern day medicine males do not live to 120 ( and there are valid reasons to discount this possibility from our modern day understanding of human ageing, I can go on about why this is extremely unlikely ). The oldest male gender on the planet lived to 113.5 years and this was with lots of medical support. Women can live up to 120 and above but not men ( again for many reasons )\n\nAlso there are places in the Pali Canon where the Buddha was said to have taught that women were foolish, when those same Suttas in the Agama Canon does not say this at all \u2026 instead saying that the woman addressed to was stupid ( ie:- targeting the individual, not the gender ). This could however be due to a linguistic drift as scholars of language points out that all you needed was to drop a single word to change the target from being an individual who is a woman to just women in general ( but you cannot do it the other way round .. so the Agama is more accurate than the Pali on this one ).\n\nThe idea that a person is born a woman due to lesser merit simply has no basis in the Pali Canon. To be born a human is of great merit. There is also no idea that a woman is of lesser status spiritually ( otherwise how can women become Arhats with equal potential to men? )\n\nPlus remember the Buddha was the first to tell people who grieved that they had daughters to not grief for daughters can be as good as sons. Now seen in this light you could argue that the Buddha was being sexist but remember He was COMFORTING people who were otherwise going to give away their baby daughters. Instead He admonishes them to raise up their daughters well for a daughter can be moral, can be wise, can be a good mother and a good wife etc.. and can be as reliable as sons. He was not going to berate them in their time of distress for being sexist \u2026 He was comforting them and encouraging them to keep their daughters. That the Buddha saw daughters as precious ( and even exclaimed that Khujuttura was a daughter He would have liked ) meant that the Buddha saw sons and daughters to be coequals. He just struggled to tell people that directly when They are lamenting about having more daughters than sons.  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the sexism is real. \n\nThe Bhikkhuni monastic codes having more rules than the male monastic codes. There is no doubt this is sexism. While you can argue these were mostly brought forth to the Buddha by the nuns, the Buddha knows how to count and ending up having more rules for nuns than monks and allowing for it ( despite being asked ) is problematic for sure. \n\n( Of course, the Buddha also founded the first women spiritual and monastic movement in the world so maybe we can cut Him some slack on this one ).\n\nThe other part where the sexism is very real is the Buddha\u2019s idea of the role of women.\n\nThe Buddha clearly saw women as only having six acceptable roles \u2026. daughter, mother, wife, nun, landholder ( ie:- farmer who owns her own land ) and womanly crafts ( ie:- a master craftsmen in the light domestic crafts of weaving, baking, clothes making etc.. )\n\nEDIT:- I should probably clarify that the womanly crafts part is in fact rather radical for its time. Prior to the Buddha, women were expected to master the craft of their husbands. Prior to the Buddha, most daughters were only used as extra hands in the parents trade with the entire trade mostly taught to the sons ( or apprentices who are males ). The Buddha made a radical statement that women can be mistress of their own crafts ( this means the kind of crafts women can be practice alongside their husband ). This means that UNLIKE their non Buddhist counterparts, Buddhist laywomen were encouraged to master and be independent mistresses of their own crafts and do not need to bother to master the husband\u2019s craft. This means, if you married a blacksmith, your non Buddhist counterpart ( because women cannot practice blacksmithery ) is just forced to be a housewife. Meanwhile a Buddhist wife can still do her weaving as a trade or string making etc.. This meant financial independence for women outside their dependency from men. This also meant trade independence ( ie:- there were now women masters who can teach apprentices their craft and not wait upon the men to teach it ). This also meant that daughters get taught the totality of crafts. \n\n( Landownership for women was already becoming a thing in the Buddha\u2019s time, the Buddha merely heavily supported it. The Licchavis allowed women to own land and by default become farmers and landholders. The Buddha strongly supported this and unlike some of His contemporaries made friends with these women )\n\nMeanwhile for men there were clearly nine acceptable roles:- son, father, husband, monk, landholder, craftsmen ( ie:- this also covers the womanly craft so a male can also be a weaver and a clothesmaker but also be a blacksmith, a masculine craft ), trader ( ie:- one who travels from town to town to sell stuff ), leader of the household and the clan, leader of a faction/nation etc..\n\nNow we do have situations where women are accepted as leader of a household by the Buddha .. but unlike her male counterpart this is by accident. If the husband dies, a Buddhist woman can lead the household as leader of the household. However She is only the leader of her children and grandchildren .. not the other aspect of the household.\n\nOf course this is a MARKED improvement ( from the perspective of women of the time ). Prior to the Buddha, when the husband died the household is taken over either by the brother of the husband, or the sons. \n\nThe Buddha inverted this, when the husband dies, the wife takes over the role. Therefore at least within the immediate family the woman can be the leader \u2026 which was a huge thing in 500BCE.\n\nHowever remember, the restriction here is only for the children of the women and her grandchildren. She is NOT leader of the clan ( ie:- wider family ) \u2026 that still falls to a male. However this tiny improvement was seen as a big thing for women of the time, so much so many Buddhist laywoman praised the Buddha for giving them dignity.",

She asked them to wait until her husband returned, so they went inside, spread out their mats and sat down while they waited. The brahmin returned after nightfall and, seeing the nuns, asked his wife who the strangers were.

It was because they already had those undercurrents and, when they had to accommodate Buddhism, simply cherry picked whatever bits of doctrine would serve them. \n\nTwo good examples of this are Japan and Tibet; the status of women in Japan was actually respectably high for a good chunk of its history before the Heian period. In fact the very first Japanese Buddhist clerics were three nuns, daughters of the emperor at the time. But\u2014together with centralist political reform and the adoption of Confucianism\u2014things started to change towards the end and we could see holy mountains being declared off-limits to women by the state, for example. Once these trends were imposed from the top, they took root and the role of Japanese Buddhist women greatly diminished. They did not really take this passively and there's at least one example of what appears to be an apocryphal and overtly pro-woman scripture composed by Japanese Buddhist women.   \nTibet, if I understand correctly, did not have such a moment of imposed cultural change and the position of women remained much more balanced. For that reason, there are many female saints who are known and praised in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nBasically, a power structure which wanted to keep women at a lower status could easily downplay subversive elements in Buddhism and focus on the elements that would support the status quo.\n\nBuddhism diverges significantly from Christianity etc. in that it also has very significant texts which promote the value of women.\n\n> I think I understand your point seeing how women go through harder times, being the softer sex.\n\nI don't believe that the situation of women is because they are \"softer\" (Buddhist texts also don't imply this) but mostly because society evolved that way. The remaining part is about biological aspects; men simply don't have to deal with periods and pregnancies for example. But this is a more minor aspect compared to the other. Buddhists appear to have been pretty pessimistic with regards to how the situation for women might change in future eras.",

On the contrary, they even openly feature such women. Also in MN73, Vaccahagotta the wanderer asks the whether there is even a single nun who has attained arhatship, and the Buddha says that there are hundreds of such women. Likewise for lower grades of attainment as it relates to laypeople, the Buddha affirms over and over that women are capable of attainments as much as men.\n\nYour assumptions about what Buddhism says about women are incorrect. In scripture, there's *never* any ambiguity with regards to the capacity of women when it comes to arhatship. Buddhahood is the matter of contention, and it seems like it has always been part of a tug-of-war, hence why some of the most important Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras specifically set out to contradict the idea that women are deficient in this regard. It's also not the case that the texts just maintain that women would do better to be reborn as men; that isn't the case in the \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na. In the Mah\u0101y\u0101na it's recommended for the ease it brings for bodhisattva practice, but is not necessary.\n\nWe do agree, but in order to fight this discriminatory thought in Buddhism, we also do need to understand what is actually being said and why.",

Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b says that it can and as an example introduces the girl and describes her as having attained all kinds of extremely advanced attainments, and that \"she is able to attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.\" This is important. Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b literally says this without any ambiguity. It goes without saying but here Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b represents the correct teaching, and the subsequent dramatic events essentially play out to prove him right.\n\nPraj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da then says that he finds it hard to believe that this girl can attain buddhahood in an instant when she supposedly hasn't undergone aeons of practice at the Buddha has.  \nThe girl appears and declares that she will become a buddha and teach extensively.  \n\u015a\u0101riputra then praises her enthusiasm, but tells her that there's no way she can do this since she's a woman, and therefore cannot become a buddha in an instant.  \nThe girl then gives the buddha a jewel, makes Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra confirm that this was done extremely quickly, and tells them to watch her become a buddha even faster than that, in an instant. Then she instantly manifests the completion of a male bodhisattva's career. Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra and others who shared their thoughts can do nothing but accept in silence.\n\nThere are two ways of looking at this. One is a shallow way which consists of thinking that this whole section endorses the suggestions made by Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra, that is, that the girl needs to complete practices for aeons and needs to be a man in order to become a buddha. Thus there's a focus on the sex that was manifested in this display and this is read as confirming the ordinary thought expressed by Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra.\n\nThis, however, begs the question as to why this entire section would even exist, why Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b would bring in specifically a girl to contradict Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da in the first place. It also doesn't account for \u015a\u0101riputra joining in with Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da's doubts and focusing specifically on the girl's sex. The narrative is very clearly structured in such a way that Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b's claim is correct, that Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra haven't understood, and that the dragon girl will serve as a device for making this point. Note also that Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da says nothing about her sex but focuses on the time necessary for attaining buddhahood.\n\nA deeper way to look at this story is to see it as the dragon girl, having already attained the principle of the Lotus Sutra's teaching, is simply showing displays. When \"she transforms\" into a man, it's just a display. When she accomplishes the bodhisattva practices, that is only a display, she has already completed them, instantly. Appearing as a man and becoming a buddha are all things that were in her full control, she was not controlled by those things. \n\nIn other words, this is not a process of seeing a being go through gradual practice and change to become a buddha. It's the instant manifestation of a foregone conclusion. She is at such a stage that she can contradict Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra (she is a girl who has attained buddhahood instantly) but can also still manifest a conventional display in accordance with what others want or need to see. This ties into the larger message of the sutra, that a buddha does this, even with regards to something like parinirvana even though they don't reflect ultimate truth.",

In this case, applying that principle, we assume that the narrative is making a point by having her transform into a male before she is able to become a Buddha. The self-evident reason, Thich Nhat Hanh argues, was the prevailing belief at the time that a woman could not achieve Buddhahood without first experiencing rebirth as a male. To interpret this aspect of the narrative as \"reinforcement\" of the belief that women *could* become Buddhas is to utterly negate the fact that she had to become a male first.  \n\nAnother interpretive principle would be to take into account the context of related literature and oral tradition.  I must confess to not having conducted this research, so I will simply ask you the question: do you argue that Buddhist writings and accounts of the oral tradition in the 500-odd years following the Buddha's *parinirvana* do *not* establish the prevailing expectation that women could not become Buddhas?

She merely creates such a display. My argument accounts for this and does not treat it as superfluous, then, as I said that it is a display that accords with necessity. What you're saying here however treats every other bit of the passage, and the rest of the sutra, as superfluous as it disregards everything I've said about the implications of the presence and claims made by Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b, Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra.\n\n> do you argue that Buddhist writings and accounts of the oral tradition in the 500-odd years following the Buddha's *parinirvana* do *not* establish the prevailing expectation that women could not become Buddhas?\n\nSome do, others don't.

The Lotus Sutra sets out to clarify and rectify many doctrinal elements, and many of these (such as the limitless nature of \"buddha\") have old roots and are not new ideas that were invented on the spot 500 years after the Buddha.\n\n> then how can you interpret the girl's transformation into a boy before becoming a Buddha as \"reinforcing\" the opposite view? First, it doesn't logically reinforce the opposite view; it contradicts it. \n\nIf you're thinking along the lines of Praj\u00f1\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da and \u015a\u0101riputra and are disregarding the vast wisdom of Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b, then yes, it's a contradiction. If you understand that the girl was just performing a display, as the Buddha goes on to explain with regards to what buddhas do in further detail in the text, there's no contradiction.\n\nTo use an analogy, imagine a queen who's the supreme sovereign of her country. She has the authority and the power to do anything she wants. Imagine that there was some building in her kingdom with a special rule: you have to be dressed in red clothes to enter. Now the queen, if she wanted to enter, could just do so in whatever appearance she wanted to. But in order to accord with the wishes and expectations of the owner and other clients, she might dress in red. Would this mean that the queen *had to* dress in red to enter? No. She had the power to accord with that ruling if she wished to, and she did so out of respect. But her admittance into that building, in itself, was a foregone conclusion.  \nIf someone saw this happen, but did not know the extent of the queen's power, they might very well wrongly say that she obeyed the ruling of the owner.\n\nIn the case, the opposite view is supported, logically or otherwise. It's only the elusiveness of a buddha with a female body which creates a difficulty. But that doesn't matter that much when we remember that the question of sex here is incidental. Whether *any person* can \"instantly\" attain buddhahood through the understanding and practice of the Lotus Sutra's teaching is the matter under consideration. And in order to show that it is possible, Ma\u00f1jusr\u012b brings in a little girl. If the point was to show that only a man can accomplish this, then this wouldn't have happened to begin with. A male bodhisattva playing the same role would have accomplished that, his mere presence would have confirmed that such high attainment is uniquely the province of men.\n\n> And second, how can you reinforce that which didn't exist at the time?\n\nI said this in the beginning, but tensions about the sex of buddhas and the idea of female buddhahood did not start with the Lotus Sutra.

Maybe ascetic practice where I live is just higher skill level (or just (forced) exericises of sadism\u2013masochism or antisociality, or actively unsupported & prevented).",

It's not simply a film about showcasing an exotic and esoteric subject, but has a mission because it intends to give viewers a personal taste of the art of the busshi.\n\nThis is a film about many contrasts: the contrast between the definitely-not-serene carving process (as one of the teachers puts it, this is hard and no-nonsense craftsman work, not Buddhist training!), between the harshness and gentleness the teachers have to cycle through between work and home life, between the masterful work that goes into the statues and the general indifference in Japan towards them...  \nPerhaps most fundamentally, between the ineffable nature of ultimate awakening and the physical reality of the statues which represent it. Or is that really so? After all, referring to the paintings he had brought with him, K\u016bkai said:\n\n> The Dharma is originally beyond words, yet without words it cannot be revealed. Suchness transcends the physical world, yet realization depends on it. Though we may confuse the finger for the moon it points at, the teachings that remove confusion are limitless. These paintings are not to be valued as rare and curious sights. Indeed, they are treasures that bring peace to the nation and benefit to the people. The esoteric treasury is deep and mysterious, and difficult to express in writing. Yet through the provisional use of diagrams and paintings, it can be revealed to the unawakened. The many postures and the many mudr\u0101s depicted [in these] arise from the universal compassion of the Dharmak\u0101ya. Through a single glimpse of a ma\u1e47\u1e0dala, buddhahood is attained.\n\nSuspicion of imagery is common among Western Buddhists, and even if there's no suspicion, then statues and paintings are often dismissed as being mere reminders for the benefit of the individual. Watching Carving the Divine might open more eyes to the fact that this is not so for a large portion of Buddhists. It would certainly be absurd to keep thinking of these things as mere reminders after witnessing the effort and the suffering put into creating them, and the cultural heritage that flows through the statues made by each new generation. Ultimately, the point really is to... carve the divine.\n\nI almost forgot to mention how great the film itself is, purely in terms of cinematography and so on, but it is. All the awards and positive coverage it got are entirely deserved.\n\nI hope that a lot of people will watch it and take away something valuable.",

In the U.S., where I am, by and large I think Buddhist organizations tend to be on the more accepting and affirming side of things, especially when compared to conservative Christianity. I am exploring Jodo Shu and Jodo Shinshu Buddhism (aka Shin Buddhism), and in the US, the Buddhist Churches of America are explicitly affirming, with some of their temples sporting pride colors for pride month. That said, while the Dharma and Sangha make Buddhism one of the more accepting religions, it isn't like anyone who becomes a Buddhist is instantly purified of all bigotry, and homophobic Buddhists do exist, I am sure. However, the key rule on sex for laypeople at least is the 3rd Precept, which is ultimately non-dogmatic. Basically, the sex you have should not cause suffering, so the gender of the people engaging in it is not so important as the context surrounding it. Do the people involved love each other? Is this just a casual thing, and if so, is that properly understood by all parties so that no one is emotionally hurt? Is everyone involved of age and able to properly consent? These are the more important questions to ask when one is having sex, both as a Buddhist and just as a person more broadly. \n\nFurther, bigotry betrays the attachment of the bigot to their views on sexuality, which causes suffering both for the targets of their bigotry and for themselves. I am bisexual, and that is pretty much impossible to change without serious damage to my psyche. But becoming a more accepting and understanding person is a healthy and healing process. A bigoted person who learns to accept lgbtqia+ people will become calmer and less confrontational to their fellow human beings than they were previously. By letting go of their attachment to straightness as default, they become free of the suffering in their own minds, and simultaneously those who they are bigoted against also become free from the negative affects of their attachment and their resulting actions. \n\nFinally, on the topic of gender specifically, many Buddhist figures are seen to transcend gender constructs. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be depicted as different genders in different cultures, for example, and it is said that they can manifest as a variety of different beings to teach the Dharma. The most well-known case of this is Avalokitesvara. This is the Sanskrit name for the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion (also known as the Regarder of the Cries of the World), one of the most well known and most venerated and even worshiped Bodhisattvas in Buddhism. In Indian traditions, he is seen as a man. However, in China the same Bodhisattva is named Guanyin, and is depicted as a woman. Yet it is important to note that if you were to ask a practicing monk from China or India or Tibet about either one, they would know them as the same figure. Furthermore, the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion is talked about in the Lotus Sutra (Ch. 25) where the Buddha talks about how they may manifest as a great number of beings from animals to humans to devas(heavenly beings) to help teach us the Dharma if we call their name.",

The idea of two men or women being in the sort of relationship needed for sexual activity to not be misconduct did not exist back then, and I think we have to keep that in mind. So I agree that there is no good grounding to be homophobic from the Buddhist perspective.\n\nBe well - \u963f\u5f4c\u9640\u4f5b, Namo Adida Phat",

As the Buddha pointed out this is wrong view, a form of eternalism, just as the view that there is no self at all is nihilism according to the Buddha. There is no such thing as a fixed, immortal self or soul to go from life to life.  What is reborn is our Karma, or karmic momentum as it were, according to the Buddha.   \n\n\nAs he repeatedly pointed out, there is no self apart from the Skandhas and they arise together, since there is no first cause and no creator. These teachings are contained in the doctrine of dependent origination, or Pa\u1e6dicca-samupp\u0101da if you want investigate more. You can find out about that from any reputable Buddhist teacher or siteand it can help clarify things. However, since you ask a good question, these quotes from Buddhist teachers, including Ven. Rahula, may also help:\n\nAs Ven. Walpola Rahula puts it in the classic work 'What The Buddha Taught:'\n\n*'If we can understand that in this life we can continue without a permanent, unchanging substance like Self or Soul, why can't we understand that those forces themselves can continue without a Self or Soul behind them after the non-functioning of the body?*\n\n*When this physical body is no more capable of functioning, energies do not die with it, but continue to take some other shape or form, which we call another life... Physical and mental energies which constitute the so-called being have within themselves the power to take a new form, and grow gradually and gather force to the full.'*\n\nDaido Roshi put  it this way:\n\n*'The Buddha\u2019s experience was that when you go beyond the skandhas, beyond the aggregates, what remains is nothing. The self is an idea, a mental construct. That is not only the Buddha\u2019s experience, but the experience of each realized Buddhist man and woman from 2,500 years ago to the present day. That being the case, what is it that dies?*\n\n*There is no question that when this physical body is no longer capable of functioning, the energies within it, the atoms and molecules it is made up of, don\u2019t die with it. They take on another form, another shape. You can call that another life, but as there is no permanent, unchanging substance, nothing passes from one moment to the next. Quite obviously, nothing permanent or unchanging can pass or transmigrate from one life to the next. Being born and dying continues unbroken but changes every moment.'*\n\nVen. Rahula also made clear the position from the standpoint of the Dharma with regard to ideas of a soul, or immortal, fixed self:\n\n*'Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self, or \u0100tman. According to the teaching of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary, false belief which has no corresponding reality, and it produces harmful thoughts of \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018mine\u2019, selfish desire, craving, attachment, hatred, ill-will, conceit, pride, egoism, and other defilements, impurities and problems. It is the source of all the troubles in the world from personal conflicts to wars between nations. In short, to this false view can be traced all the evil in the world.*\n\n*Two ideas are psychologically deep-rooted in man; self-protection and self-preservation. For self-protection man has created God, on whom he depends for his own protection, safety and security, just as a child depends on its parent. For self-preservation man has conceived the idea of an immortal Soul or \u0100tman, which will live eternally. In his ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire, man needs these two things to console himself. Hence he clings to them deeply and fanatically.*\n\n*The Buddha\u2019s teaching does not support this ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire, but aims at making man enlightened by removing and destroying them, striking at their very root. According to Buddhism, our ideas of God and Soul are false and empty. Though highly developed as theories, they are all the same extremely subtle mental projections, garbed in an intricate metaphysical and philosophical phraseology. These ideas are so deep-rooted in man, and so near and dear to him, that he does not wish to hear, nor does he want to understand, any teaching against them.*\n\n*The Buddha knew this quite well. In fact, he said that his teaching was \u2018against the current\u2019 (pa\u1e6disotag\u0101mi), against man\u2019s selfish desires.'*\n\nVen.

The only one making things up here is you, since you don't know such core teachings as dependant origination and clearly haven't bothered to look up how such terms came to be translated as they are since Buddhist suttas and other texts began to be studied in the West. Rebirth has been a common translation for over a century by the way. Did you not do any research before trying to impose your view on what Buddhism does and does not teach, or are you just another troll, which this group is so famous for?\n\nAnd yes, you are right in that some Buddhists do indeed talk about reincarnation as though it's the same as rebirth. They're still incorrect. Many Christians also talk about  things that are not in fact Christian teaching and many who are nominally Buddhist know that much about the Dharma. It's not about what individuals may or may not say. It's not a thing where if a lot of people say something, that that somehow makes it true. It doesn't. The Suttas for example, the earliest record of the Buddhas teachings, are quite clear - there is no self that reincarnates, therefore belief in reincarnation is a form of what the Buddha called 'eternalism,' and which he repeatedly and specifically rejected. Did you not at least look at the Suttas before asking?\n\nRemember also that whatever your particular bias, or whatever you want to believe personally, the Buddha was quite explicit - there is no soul, no self that goes from life to life. You may not agree, but that's what Buddhism and the Buddha taught regardless of what you want it to be.\n\nIf you do however want to find out more about studying for example the Suttas in their original languages, which make clear that rebirth is not the same as reincarnation, I'd be happy to direct you to places such as Hanazano university in Japan, which has world renowned translators of Buddhist texts, Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University in Thailand, which has the same, or the School of Oriental And African Studies in the UK - again world famous for the quality of some of it's translation, preservation and study of Buddhist texts.  And I do mean this offer quite seriously. I have contacts in those places, who will be happy to go through with you such things as why rebirth and reincarnation are different, the core teaching of dependent origination and so on.\n\nYou won't of course do anything of the sort, even though you're being offered a great opportunity, because you don't want your beliefs to be shown as not accurate and clearly you have no real interest in what Buddhism actually teaches. In other words, you're not trying to find out anything, didn't read what Buddhist teachers have to say on this, or even ask one, and are it seems just a troll. So either be wiling to actually learn, or stop wasting yours and other's time. My time is valuable, even if you don't think yours is. I will block you now, but you can always get in touch via the website, so long as you are serious. Just be sure to mention that you asked on here and I offered you some expert contacts to talk to, and my assistant will know to give you that information. Good bye and be well.",

Of course, it is clear that there were many great experts of the language in the home countries of these languages who did not publish much. But there is expertise outside as well.\n\nThe argument that regional cultural context is required is harder to break down. The precise social and historical context is hard to get, and usually it is impossible to avoid anachronisms. This problem is exaggerated when we apply some apparent social context to get the meaning. It has been suggested that even ancient commentators did not sometimes correctly understand the life and times of the Buddha.

By studying modern Tibetic languages, you can collect a lot of good data and apply a few basic heuristics (such as Occam's razor) to make a conclusion about the meaning of a Classical Tibetan word. As a minor example, we know from modern languages that the word *sbom po* means \"thick\", but only for cylindrical objects. This nuance is missed by most Classical Tibetan translators. This is a silly example but it can be applied to every aspect of the grammar and lexicon.\n\nJust as we can use modern languages to help inform us about older languages, so too can we use modern cultural knowledge to help inform us about older cultural knowledge.

It may be discussed in the commentaries, too.\n\n>Yathabutha nana is not 'true knowledge'.\n\nThat's how the translator renders it, so the term is not omitted. It is not a bad translation either, in my opinion. Yathabhuta nyanya means knowing things in accordance with how they are. It makes sense to use the term \"true\" for this, going by a correspondence theory of truth. I would personally use a different term to avoid conflation with sacca, but I don't think this translation is *incorrect*, really.\n\n>It's not. Bhumi here refers to the fact that they live on earth not that they have to do anything to do the earth itself.\n\nSure, but I think it's fine to translate it one way and then explain what it means in a commentary. The translation itself is straightforward: bhumma = earth, deva = gods. So translating it as \"earth gods\" is not really incorrect, even if we feel that it might be misunderstood. I would prefer the translation \"terrestrial gods\", but that's a pretty minor edit IMO. It's a valuable note to make, all the same.\n\n>There is a lot of translation errors too. All most all the sutras has some mistranslated word or a thing. I can't obviosly list them all here.\n\nSure, I think \"wholesome\" for kusala and \"formations\" for sankhara are good examples of bad translations. I would consider those translations to be incorrect since they completely misunderstand the grammar of the terms involved. I think Bhante Sujato understands the grammar of the Pali, and is just making a translation choice that perhaps doesn't clearly convey the full idea of the term.\n\n>Translations should be easily understanble without any other resources imo.\n\nI think this is really the crux of the issue. This is just one of many different values we might have when it comes to translation, but it's not an objective stance. I personally don't agree with this value for many reasons; for example, this isn't how Pali does things anyway. Terms are mentioned briefly in one sutta and only described fully in another sutta, or in a commentary. It's always been necessary to *become educated* in order to understand Buddhist texts, and this may involve referring to other resources for more context, *especially* when a text is being transfered from one culture to another.",

I think that's kind of built into the problem.\n\nHOWEVER, it's fair to say that it works both ways. Buddhism is relatively new to the west, but it has still taken root. Undoubtedly, there are wholly legitimate forms of Buddhist practice in the west that have already incorporated aspects of western culture. These cultural nuances may be just as opaque to eastern practitioners as the nuances of Sri Lankan Theravadin practice may be to a Buddhist in California.\n\nI think what's important ultimately is that we don't allow these cultural differences to become an obstacle to mutual understanding.

An ideal follower of Buddha sticks to their principles and the path no matter the situation. I believe the venerable master mentioned \"turning it around\" in contrast to \"being turned by it\" to refer to the dichotomy of who is in control when we encounter a situation, the situation or us.\n\n> **It is difficult to have a good understanding of skill-in-means.** To understand the right expedient method to use in teaching and transforming living beings is also not easy.\n\nDifferent Dharma methods are suitable for different sentient beings in different stages of development. Someone preaching Buddhism needs to be able to prescribe the right medicine for each patient. \n\nIf you're still curious about the idea of \"skill-in-means,\" the Sanskrit term for it is *up\u0101ya*.",

If we get swept up in the storm of karma and our every day life, it would be difficult to cultivate wholesome states and our liberation from suffering. It's difficult because it's normal to react (\"moved by it\") to something (\"see a state\"), so we must practice not losing it and keeping a cool mind.\n\n> It is difficult to have a good understanding of skill-in-means.\n\nSkill-in-means (often I seen it translated as skillful means or expedient means) refers to methods that are readily useful in helpful in assisting someone along the path, though it may not be necessarily ultimately true. This is greatly discussed in the Lotus Sutra, where the Buddha describes using a variety of skillful means based on the inclinations of each being, since each being has different needs and characteristics. It's like how when teaching students, a teacher might need to present a concept in a couple different ways to cater to each student (for example, circles can be depicted on a geometric shape on a graph, as the formula x^2 + y^2 = r^2, as the result of equidistant points from a locus, but each definition has it's purpose in different situations). Since there's so many different types of beings, there's so many different inclinations to consider, hence it's difficult to pinpoint what's best for who.",

For example: \n\n>Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable S\u0101riputta unless they\u2019re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged? \n\nThis is not just a randomly chosen list of negative adjectives. \"Hater\" and \"delusional\" correspond to two of the Three Posions.\u00a0 Perhaps a \"fool\" is someone who gives in to lust or gluttony, and thus corresponds to the final posion. \"Mentally deranged\" may have been chosen to describe a person who is not infected by the three poisons, per se, but may just be mentally ill to the point where they are unable to appreciate Sariputta's goodness (distinct from \"delusional\" because it doesn't involve wrong view in the classic sense, merely illness). Thus, the brief passage, far from a relatively disposable comment, actually reinforces lessons about the Three Poisons. \n\nIn a similar vein: \n\n>He\u2019s considered astute, S\u0101riputta, free of anger. Few in wishes, sweet, tamed, the hermit shines in the Teacher\u2019s praise! \n\n>[. . .] \n\n>He\u2019s considered astute, S\u0101riputta, free of anger. Few in wishes, sweet, tamed; developed and well-tamed, he bides his time.\n\nOne could tie these superlatives to the opposite of the three poisons. \"Free of anger\" is obvious, as is \"sweet.\" Those are the opposite of anger/hatred.\n\n\"Few in wishes\" would be the opposite of greed/lust. \n\nAnd what is the opposite of delusion? Well, insight, but perhaps insight is captured by the remaining superlatives: developed, well-tamed, and biding his time. One who has insight would certainly be called \"developed,\" and \"well-tamed\" might be considered the opposite of wild -- in other words, Sariputra has transcended the natural delusion that human beings are born into or learn early in life, and is thus no longer wild in this sense; he is trained. Well-tamed could also refer to his insightful control over his emotions, generally. As for biding his time, that could also be considered insightful; possessing wisdom, he no longer runs frantically as we do when we lack wisdom and insight.\n\nSo I think there is much more here than just a simple ode to Sariputra. If the words are chosen carefully -- which we must assume they are -- then there is always meaning to find. \n\nThank you for posting \ud83d\ude4f",

I'm glad you found the perspective interesting and helpful!\n\nI think it is very important that we remain free to interpret discourses for ourselves, so long as we do so within reason. While strict adherence to original language is an important interpretive tool, it should not necessarily be elevated above common sense understanding in every instance. The fact is, no one knows the exact words that the Buddha used.  Nor did the Buddha even speak Pali or Sanskrit. As Master Thich Nhat Hanh explains:\n\n>For four hundred years during and after the Buddha\u2019s lifetime, his teachings were transmitted only orally. After that, monks in the Tamrashatiya School (\u201cthose who wear coppercolored robes\u201d) in Sri Lanka, a derivative of the Vibhajyavada School, began to think about writing the Buddha\u2019s discourses on palm leaves, and it took another hundred years to begin. ***By that time, it is said that there was only one monk who had memorized the whole canon and that he was somewhat arrogant. The other monks had to persuade him to recite the discourses so they could write them down. When we hear this, we feel a little uneasy knowing that an arrogant monk may not have been the best vehicle to transmit the teachings of the Buddha.***\n\n>Even during the Buddha\u2019s lifetime, there were people such as the monk Arittha, who misunderstood the Buddha\u2019s teachings and conveyed them incorrectly.  ***It is also apparent that some of the monks who memorized the sutras over the centuries did not understand their deepest meaning, or at the very least, they forgot or changed some words. As a result, some of the Buddha\u2019s teachings were distorted even before they were written down*** . . . .\n\n>[. . .]\n\n>***There are other instances where teachings of the Buddha have been inserted in the wrong place*** . . . .\n\n>[. . .]\n\n> . . . . ***We have to remember that the Buddha did not speak Pali, Sanskrit, or Prakrit.*** It is surmised that he spoke a language close to Pali and some think this was Ardhamagadhi, and there is no record of the Buddha\u2019s words in his own language . . . .\n\nThich Nhat Hanh, *The Heart of the Buddha's Teachings*, at pp. 13-16 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, while \"[s]utras are essential guides for our practice,\" it is imperative that we \"read them carefully and ***use our own intelligence***\" in additon to \"the help of a teacher and a Sangha\" in order \"to understand the true meaning and put it into practice.\" *Id.* at 17 (emphasis added). \n\nThanks for your kind words, and be well \ud83d\ude4f",

And whilst you were thus suffering, you have, verily, shed more tears upon this long way than there is water in the four oceans...  \n>  \n>...But how is this possible?  \nInconceivable is the beginning of this Samsara; not to be discovered is any first beginning of beings, who, obstructed by ignorance, and ensnared by craving, are hurrying and hastening through this round of rebirths...\n\nAnd when he says he teaches what is connected with the goal (nibbana), the holy life etc, that includes the fact that we're reborn according to our deeds:\n\n>For, owners of their deeds (karma) are the beings, heirs of their deeds; their deeds are the womb from which they sprang; with their deeds they are bound up; their deeds are their refuge. Whatever deeds they do-good or evil-of such they will be the heirs.  \nAnd wherever the beings spring into existence, there their deeds will ripen; and wherever their deeds ripen, there they will earn the fruits of those deeds, be it in this life, or be it in the next life, or be it in any other future life.  \nThere will come a time, when the mighty ocean will dry up, vanish, and be no more. There will come a time, when the mighty earth will be devoured by fire, perish, and be no more.

Gods are simply *another* type of being found within samsara, that one can be reborn as. \n\nIn Buddhism what we're really asking is the following: since life is so short and death could come at any time, *what is worthy of our attention and effort in this life*? Lord Buddha was very clear on that: the development of sila (precepts), samadhi (concerntration) and panna (wisdom)",

What for years and year you thought was, wasn\u2019t. New perspectives opened to you, and now you find yourself on the path, more or less. \n\nDo you \u201cbelieve\u201d in Enlightenment? \n\nFor centuries and centuries, people have been dedicating their lives to the Dharma. *All* their lives. Every waking hour. Some are in a perpetual state of meditation, or post-meditational awareness, without pause. Now think about your relatively limited experience with mediation, and the sacrifice and patience and diligence it requires, and scale it up. Can you imagine the potential for even more progress in the opening of your perspective and your understanding of reality, exponential progress that you maybe cannot imagine right now, stuck as you are in your samsaric commitments, still burdened by the weight of worldly concerns. Can you at least imagine that there is a path before you and that it is more vast and profound that you current and Nader stand it to be. Leave alone believe it, can you imagine it. \n\nIf you steep yourself in the Dharma, you find its truth in escapable. And you know that there have been many before you who have seen that truth, who have looked at reality like you have, and seen a little farther too. And you trust that they started where you started. The Buddha started right where you started too. And he arrived, with the exact same tools you\u2019re using right now, at this certainty in the relative existence of rebirth. Why would the Buddha, and Buddhist over centuries, who spent their lives steeped in the Dharma and the basic guiding principles that you\u2019ve found for yourself, who has seen their power, why would these people just tap out at the edge of wisdom and throw some kind of a place-holder into their system. If they used these tools, and lived the Dharma, every part of it that you agree with, that has been proven to you *by* you, and that you have faith in, save this one last little part, why would they suddenly say \u201cI know\u201d instead of \u201cI don\u2019t, I have reached the limit of my knowledge of the world\u201d. Do you believe that the Buddha reached the limit of knowledge of the world? Or do you believe that he decided to cop out once he got to the edge? That he came to the outskirts of his ignorance and instead of facing that ignorance, came back with a lie, a kind of prophylactic for the people who trusted him?\n\nThis is *the* fundamental question you have to ask yourself if you want to know whether you are a Buddhist or just Buddh-ish. It is the lynchpin of Refuge, of Bodhicitta, of any kind of faith in the Dharma. \n\nPeople make a mistake when they equate \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cfaith\u201d. People *believe* when they want to make life easier, when they want to dampen their suffering and say \u201cthat\u2019s enough, I\u2019ll just take this pile of beliefs and build myself a shelter out of them to protect myself from samsara\u201d. Faith is something different. Having faith means not knowing, and knowing that you don\u2019t know. It means being willing to dive off the deep end and fully embrace the unknown, instead of trying to answer for it. And it also involves the humility to say \u201cI\u2019m not there yet and just because I haven\u2019t seen it it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there\u201d. It doesn\u2019t mean blindly giving yourself over to something, or to zombify yourself in the name of some answer; that\u2019s belief. \n\nFaith is asking yourself what you have to lose by saying, \u201cmaybe this guy actually did reach the edge of knowledge and pass into the domain of ultimate, primordial wisdom. Maybe it\u2019s worth entertaining this idea, to jump into the unknown of it, and see what your not-knowing could ultimately bring you in terms of basic sanity, compassion, joy, maybe even enlightenment\u201d\n\nIf rebirth is real, then it follows that we\u2019ve been rebirthing eternally, and from that it might also follow that every sentient being that you encounter in you\u2019re life was once your mother, who love you and raised you and protected you. Sure some might have been bad mothers to you in one lifetime, but on this scale, that same mother was once the most wonderful mother imaginable. \n\nIf you can entertain that thought, even at the least just say \u201chey, maybe it *could* be true. I sure don\u2019t *know* either way, because there is, after all, a whole lot I don\u2019t know\u201d. It you could truly, genuinely live that thought, how might it affect the way you move through the world and engage with others? It would have a tremendous impact, and a very different one than the faith that says, \u201chey, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a heaven or a hell, but I sure wouldn\u2019t like to be caught in one of them if they did exist.\u201d It\u2019s a faith that could improve the world in remarkable ways.\n\nYou have to ask your, what is the value of your current *belief* (or anti-belief). What has it gotten you? Guilt over birthday parties? Shame? What if you tried giving up your desire to be absolutely certain? How is that obsession with certainty affecting your life? You don\u2019t have to be certain about rebirth; skepticism is natural. You could argue that\u2019s it\u2019s Dharmic as well.

Mental clinging is what creates Samsara - so look at how objects of your consciousness are born (the idea of a lamp you own as an object in your mind), grow old (the power cord wears down), and die (lamp stops working and is thrown out).\n\nThen, later on you remember the lamp - it's possible that you could pine over the loss of the lamp, or remember it fondly and hold it in mind. Just like when the lamp was a physical thing, the thought of it grows old, less satisfying, and dies.\n\nBut your mind brought the lamp back into existence, if only on a mental level.\n\nNow you go back out and buy a similar lamp, because the store doesn't make the old model anymore. The craving for the old lamp lead you to buying a new lamp, and even though it's not the same and doesn't really even matter, your craving is satisfied.\n\nDoes that make sense? Basically mental inclinations lead to physical results.\n\nAnd deeper meditation can lead to states that have a much greater focus on the mental rather than the physical aspect of one's experience. I think these states, which develop from gradual relaxation of the mind and the body, aren't forcefully induced but rather arise from the gross levels of the mind sloughing off and the more subtle layers of the mind being exposed by releasing concepts; and which are calmer. more concentrated and more alert than a mind filled with what would be called the Five Hindrances.\n\nThis can give one firsthand experience into a sharpness of mind that identifies cyclic birth and death.",

                "content": "I understand where you're coming from. I studied Buddhism in college and, until recently, disregarded the rebirth component of Buddhism as an unscientific vestige of carried over from premodern times. Over the last few months, however, the importance of this idea has finally dawned on me. Now, I cannot imagine Buddhism without it.\n\nHere's how I understand it.\n\nAs you certainly know, one of the most important teachings in Buddhism is that there is no self (\"anatt\u0101\" in Pali, \"an\u0101tman\" in Sanskrit). There are many subtleties to this idea that are worth exploring and meditating on but are beyond the scope of this particular response. The bottom line is simply that we are not what we take ourselves to be \u2014 and that with which we do identify changes dramatically over time (I 'm quite different today than I was five years ago, and I'd wager you probably are too). It's Buddhism 101, sure, but it's really important.\n\nOnce you begin to internalize the idea that the concept of an unchanging, absolute self is an illusion and that your identity (whatever you take yourself to be) changes over time as with everything else in this impermanent universe, you can begin to seriously entertain the idea of rebirth. As many here in this thread note, we are reborn countless times throughout our lives as we change from one moment to the next. It's not reincarnation we're talking about here, it's the subtler idea that we are constantly in the process of being reborn into something new. It's how we grow and evolve.\n\nThis all probably makes sense, but the biggest issue for those of us who believe in rebirth is what to make of death. At some point, a being dies. What happens to the evolving self then? Who (or what) is reborn?\n\nYou might believe in an afterlife of some kind, but let's stick with today's secular materialist account of death. According to modern science, we cease to exist upon death. In other words, we go from being *something* to *nothing*.\n\nThis account ignores something important: there's no such thing as nothing. *Nothing* literally means \"no-thing\" \u2014 it means the absence of anything. It is not a place we can go nor a thing we can become. *Nothing* literally does not exist. We think of *nothing* like it's actually something, but that's because our minds are designed to envision objects.\n\nWhat this means is that we don't disappear upon death. There's nowhere else for us to go: we don't get to escape into nothingness to spend an eternity there. All that is disrupted is one's awareness and memory of her or his self. While we are alive, our actions help shape the world that we and our fellow beings inhabit. When we die, all that remains is the world we shaped \u2014 and  the other beings who are still living in that world.\n\nIn that sense, we are yet again reborn at the point of death. Even as our consciousness of our selves and memories disintegrates, the world and the beings who inhabit it continue to exist. Because there is nowhere else to go (no nothingness to escape to), our infinite rebirth continues as those living in the world we left behind. And we do this moment to moment, life after life.\n\nIn conclusion, I find it is unhelpful to take rebirth literally as reincarnation (as some people do). I don't really buy stories of people recalling their past lives as a sign of reincarnation. Instead, I take rebirth very seriously to mean that our actions help shape the world \u2014 and (because the self is a fluid concept that changes from moment to moment)  we will continue to inhabit this world as other beings in the future.\n\nIn the same way that the self with which we identify changes moment to moment throughout our lives, it also changes from life to life. This is simply because there is nowhere else to escape to upon death: in this life, I identify as me, but, once I die, I will identify as someone else in another life. At no point in time will I get to identify as nothing or nothingness.\n\nSorry for the long-windedness of this response. Hope this is helpful. Would appreciate any feedback or additions to this.",

                "content": "I'm pretty new to this myself and I also don't fully grasp rebirth -- *as I currently understand it*. I come at this as a secular, atheist ex-Catholic with a materialist and scientific perspective. \n\nMy current understanding of death and rebirth is that it can at least be true that it's metaphorical -- when the conditions necessary for the continuous arising of consciousness in the cells of my body cease to be, my body will be reborn as a corpse. The atoms of my body will flee and become new things: gases, liquids, bacterial excretions, eventually dirt. Maybe new life will arise from that dirt one day. And many of the atoms in my body that make up \"me\" were once part of living things, thus making me the rebirth of every living thing whose parts are now in me.\n\nI like to think -- I don't *believe*, but I like to think -- that consciousness itself as it arises in these cells and consciousness as it arises in the cells that comprise other bodies are somehow part of the same whole. That all sentience -- the ability to perceive \"reality\" -- is an expression of all that is attempting to perceive itself somehow. I like to think that every sentient life that ends or begins is simply part of that same whole.\n\nIs that the wheel of dharma? Is that reincarnation? If it were true, would it be possible to spin out a new consciousness that could tap into the memories of what its matter used to be? Or maybe that's possible for all consciousness that arises from matter -- there's a crazy thought. Maybe all of us have the innate ability to tap into the consciousness that our matter used to be -- assuming conditions are right for us to accept that. (And so we sit on a cushion waiting for conditions to arise hah.)\n\nAnyway, if I told myself from 10 years ago all of that I would just assume I had done too many psychedelics, when in fact I've done almost none.\n\nAnyhow, from a practical standpoint, here's what I've learned from Buddhism thus far that applies to your question:\n\nOne: it is possible to accept the existence of apparent contradictions. Many things appear as contradictory simply because we don't know how to make sense of them, because of our limited perspectives.\n\n\nTwo: the dharma is a practice, not a goal. Well, the goal is to practice. Practicing is the goal. I don't expect to practice enough to reach some state of enlightenment, I expect that continuing to practice is enlightened behavior. \n\nThree: as I practice, as I sit, some things that seemed contradictory to me at one point tend to make more sense. You know, working to sustain myself is good, but also celebrating important days with my community and family are good. Is there not some contradiction there if one interferes with the other? Not if I sit long enough to realize that I am only capable of being at one place at one time and I must choose which place I will inhabit. If I choose the place I inhabit, my choice arose from conditions at the time I made the choice. \n\nSo it's possible that through practice, I may one day understand things that I see as contradictions -- that everything is material, but also not material. That existence is conceptual and non-conceptual. On and on. But for now, it's good enough that I accept that perhaps some potential wisdom or truth may be inaccessible to me, and focus on the wisdom and truth that are accessible.\n\nAnyway, I have bad bad \"beginner mind\" so this is really just me sharing ramblings with you. I hope they are of any value to anyone at all, and may you be happy, healthy, safe, and fulfilled with or without them. :)",

Things only start to be questioned when we ask ourselves if this applies to something as abstract as consciousness.

There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death.'\"\n\nThe thing about this sutta is that a king asked all six of those teachers the exact same question and none could give a substantial and satisfying response.

As /u/JoNeum42 pointed out, both sides involve a belief. Rejection of rebirth is also a belief. So go with practice and personal experience. Is reality based in matter, as science says? Or does it arise from mind, as Buddhism says? The latter makes more sense to me. But you don't have to decide in order to practice. You just have to let go attachment to belief.\n\nWhen people ask me what I believe I try to tell them, without being too \"clever\", that I don't believe in belief. If that sparks their curiosity then I'll explain. So far no one has expressed curiosity. :)",

The faith in the Buddha and his teachings is like the confidence you have in your doctor. If you are suffering some ailment and you trust your doctor, you wouldn't constantly question them and refuse to try their recommendations. Similarly, we practice the teachings in good faith, to progress and live a better life and eventually be free. We can be open to something, without a full understanding yet.  Without awakening, we only have a mundane understanding of the teachings. We're striving. But we have confidence in the Buddha and the Dhamma, which is why are choose to follow these teachings. We believe there is a benefit to be had. The Buddha did talk about rebirth quite a bit and it might be hard to believe in it, but ask yourself: is everything else the Buddha taught crystal clear to me? Is that the only thing I don't understand or agree with? Am I convinced about there being such a thing as awakening/enlightenment?  Is there an end to suffering? These are central ideas in Buddhism. Are you convinced about them? Why are they believable but not rebirth? They are all views. Again, I'm not saying that you have to believe in it. But we tend to believe in some things and not others, even when we can't verify any of them. It's just a tendency we have based on our upbringing, nature and world view. \n\nUnless someone is a stream enterer and has no doubts whatsover about the path, we have to be open to the possibility that we don't understand even the teachings exactly right. Thats what keeps us seeking, making effort, clarifying and trying to understand more clearly, instead of being content at our level of understanding and our own version of the truth. So, if you are not convinced, thats totally fine. I would simply try to maintain an attitude of \"I don't know\" and not make a big deal of it. I think making it a sticking point would probably hinder you more than anything else. Just do you practice with the confidence that you will understand things (the Dhamma in general, not just rebirth) better with time.  Sorry if this sounds like I'm assuming anything about your understanding. I just mean to say that it's not JUST rebirth thats hard to believe in. I've been familiar with the teachings for years, that doesn't mean my understanding is complete.  Thats why I keep meditating, contemplating the teachings and following the precepts. My life has improved but I'm under no illusion that I \"get it\". If I did, I wouldn't still suffer. Convincing yourself that you understand the Dhamma, except for the concept of rebirth, would probably be a disservice. So don't just fixate on that. Keep exploring.",

In my opinion you sound like somebody who has learned/studied more about Buddhism, so it can be inferred that you understand the suffering part, already.

But to get to the other parts, I assume off of my own life experience and knowledge, You have to understand the \"first\" part, Which is suffering. Most people don't start really getting into/understanding Buddhism until they get to that point.  \nWith all that said, it makes tons of sense for somebody to say it's \"all about suffering\". Most people who haven't suffered enough or at all, don't have any use for Buddhism. Because they are already living according to its teachings without even knowing it. According to my understanding, those people are already living in the moment. They aren't bogged down but all the innocence suffering \"takes\" from you.  \n\n\nAlso, when you were a kid, things were probably a lot different. I could go outside and have a hell of a time with a stick digging a hole or some shit. Now-a-days, kids stay inside. They are distracted just as much as adults but with even less \"time\"/knowledge to look inward. And they are born into a world that is all about money. The bride for money would be seen as inconsequential. It is something that can be seen as necessary to help smooth the ride out, and not important or even irrelevant to the over all process being tried.   \n\n\nThe \"moral\" of the note is that most religions need/have some sort of big moment where you say \"I SURRENDER\" or whatever, (not to insult other religions, just dramatization) and more so, that Buddhism doesn't and/or doesn't need one.",

Because clinging to the right things is adaptive in natural selection. A being which does not cling does not fight for resources and does not seek to propagate through reproduction. Also, the state of non-clinging is very far from the state the mind is optimized for by evolution.

In more modern terms we might say that \"neurotic attachment\" can be undone by practicing the dharma.\n\nBut another thing that he taught that I think is helpful was that we all do well to be heedful of death.  I live in a world where people do not talk about death very much, and, from the point of view of Buddhist practice, this is a problem.  It is a way of claiming this biological organism as something elevated and special -- not of the earth, unlike other plants and animals, independent of the causes and conditions that create and sustain organisms.  This leads us to cling to existence in a way that causes dissatisfaction.  We often forget this aspect of the Buddha's teachings -- the importance of seeing death squarely, the importance of what the Buddha taught as the \"five remembrances\":\n\nI am subject to aging\n\nI am subject to illness\n\nI am subject to death\n\nI will be separated fro that is dear to me\n\nI am the owner of my karma, I am subject to whatever good or bad I do\n\nWe think death is a big deal, that it is a complete extinguishing of everything we care about *because* we cling to the aggregates as \"self\".  Death happens all the time and is neither good nor bad and is as dependent on causes and conditions as breathing or digestion.  It is not worth fearing but you can't see that if you you truly believe it is the annihilation of \"I\".  There is no \"I\" to be annihilated.   As Chogyam Trungpa said, \"The bad news is that there is no parachute.  The good news is that there is no ground.\"",

Translation sometimes is very difficult because the other language lacks any word that carries the meaning of the original word. This is particularly true of English.

Plus American English and British English are very different. Hence, translating into English is a laborious task for our  hard-working translators. \n\nBut, even within English, the word Ego means very different things. I use the term ego all the time in diff ways, depending on whether we\u2019re talking about Buddhism (where I would think of ego is purely an illusion, not something that materially exists and must die), psychoanalysis, or in a plain Western context. The psychoanalysts (particularly Jacque Lacan, who posits that even conscious thought is an illusion) and philosophical pragmatists see language as just a tool - an effort to invoke our subjective sensation or image within another\u2019s mind. It\u2019s imperfect. But  it\u2019s a necessary tool. Otherwise, the Buddha would never have spoken to others. \n\nAs applied here, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say every use of the term ego death is wrong. As u/bodhiquest clarified, it\u2019s just mostly a nonsensical, catch-all term in the west. And I hear their point. Buddhism is frequently bastardized in the west, almost totally severed from the Buddha.

Here's a metaphor she's written of that has spoken to me, maybe it can speak to you: \n\nThere may not be an answer but there is joy. There is a story of a woman running away from tigers. She runs and runs and the tigers are getting closer and closer. When she comes to the edge of a cliff, looking down, she sees that there are tigers below as well. She sees a tiny crumbling ledge and climbs out to it. Tigers above, tigers below. But then she looks to the side, and she sees a little outcropping with one little strawberry close to her, growing out of a clump of leaves. She looks up and she looks down. Then she just takes the strawberry, takes a bite, and enjoys it thoroughly.\n\nFrom this I see it as each moment in life is just what it is. Life is full of tigers and there is no escaping them. That no matter what, we were born and we will die. Things will end and there will be pain. And yet... we can still appreciate it and delight in the preciousness of every single moment of our life. That just means one can make life joyful by looking around at ones life and finding those strawberries; friends, partners, volunteering, work, reading, shows, art, walking, travel, kindness... it's unique to the individual but funding those strawberries makes a life filled with tigers joyful nonetheless.\n\nI'm sorry you are struggling now, and I hope it eases.",

Suicide hotline helped me one day. Alcoholics Anonymous, Buddhism, and psychiatric help stuck with me. Working out, trying to accept myself for who I am, being willing to believe people will love me for who I am if I do so, and staying sober: these were the best practices I could find. \n\nI think the most foundational help I have found from Buddhism was allowing myself to feel my feelings without judgment and recognizing them as impermanent. This pain feels unbearable, but even sitting there wanting to die is impermanent. I tried using force to escape it\u2014such as through drugs, alcohol, and lots of sex. But this just repressed it. It also made these feelings worse for me because, when my direct efforts to control them failed, I felt even more like they were permanent. But letting myself feel my feelings and trying not to judge or control them helped me start to feel their impermanence.

Someone also needs to raise us, in a sense. Teach us to live and see things differently. Because it is our \u201dnatality\u201d which gets us stuck in the mud to begin with",

It\u2019d rather have you question the need for answers at all, pointing that those questions are symptoms of your suffering which is caused by the inability to see reality clearly and acknowledge on a level of pure and raw subjective experience that everything one might think is true and solid is in fact a misguided construct full of baseless and biased assumptions.\n\nMy flavor of buddhism is zen and its about as unreligious as it gets.\nWhat is important within that \u201dbranch\u201d is to first recognize the absolute foolishness of claiming to know how and what things are when one cannot even recognize the fundamental and basic truth about ones own mind, let alone existence. It requires a \u201dstop, sit down, shut up and observe yourself\u201d type of thing.\nWhy then even try to grasp for hope, answers, questions or any of that when one hasnt even known ones own simple and clear mind as it is truly, not only as a third person video game view chasing after an individual doing all sorts of things in a one-track world?\n\nAll these things can very easily lead to ideas of ego death, nihilism, hopelessness etc if one is down and doing really bad.\n\nBut! If youre ready to stop looking around and outside you for what your answers are then i suggest you do first things first and get better. \nSo when your health inside is up, perhaps Buddhism can give you a direction of how to approach your inner in a compassionate and healing way.\n\nEither way, i hope you\u2019ll feel better sooner than you think. I\u2019m quite sure you will feel better, even if that seems far away if even possible but nothing is permanent and with the right treatment and mindset you\u2019ll be doing better quickly. \n\nDont underestimate seeking medical help first, the questions that survive this period and stage of self and life will be there when you\u2019re feeling stronger and more at peace.\n\nTake good care of yourself please, you\u2019re worth it! \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

One cause that *might* be your issue, you'll have to reflect, is what you are telling yourself about yourself that results in feeling helpless to meet a basic human need of yours. \n\nAs an (lengthy) example, if you are needing to be understood by someone you care about and they are getting defensive instead of hearing your side, the ego might say \"this person doesn't care about me, I am doing something wrong, and I am hurting them when I didn't want to, so now I feel helpless to be able to show this person I do care, and forget that I have this need to be understood, nobody understands me\". In this example, the feelings of sadness, disconnection, and helplessness to be able to meet your needs stimulates 'depressive' pain symptoms. \n\nOne of the 8 limbs of yoga states to have 'right thoughts/mind', and to return to the example, what that might look like is: while you are sharing your troubles to be understood, the other person gets defensive, and internal pain begins to surface. Here is where there is a mental pause, to reflect on the bodies communication of pain to the ego. Connect with your ego that your upset feelings are reminders that you still have a need to communicate effectively so you can be heard, but also that the other person is responding to what's alive in them, which likely has nothing to do with you, even if something you said stimulated their pain. \n\nIf you connect to the other person and follow the trail of pain the other person goes on, pausing your own sharing for just a minute to discover the other person's missing need, one often finds that the other person wasn't able to process fully your issue when the pain of their own issues muddied the waters. Once they are reconnected to themselves, they might have the ears to hear what you have to say. Even if they can't understand your issue, you will know that it is a result of pain within them, and also that your needs to be heard can be met in other ways; both of those perspectives about understanding others and ourselves turn the 'depressive' thoughts and evaluations into strategies to meet those missing needs. \n\nStrategies, feelings, needs, communication... if what I'm saying doesn't register or connect with what you think is the issue, then don't worry about this whole comment! Haha. If this kinda rings home and you want to know more, [this youtube](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNVcESwoWu4lI9C3bhkYIWB8-dphbzJ3) goes into depth on how to connect the feelings to missing needs in order to reconnect with ourselves and others.",

Answer is obviously yes. So why should I feel like I'm not worthy or destined for success because i failed an exam? There are deep rooted thought processes and behaviors that have its roots from adolescence and our relationship with our parents and the world. When you feel like you aren't worthwhile to one or both of your parents, you can end up growing up being very hard on yourself and chase happiness through things that dont neccesarily make you happy which you believe maybe they will be proud of me. But your parents love and encouragement or lack thereof has nothing to do with your value as a person. This may or may not be useful to you but this  is all I kinda know on the subject lol. I'm not sure if clinical depression is neurological or psychological/cognitive but if so I not knowledgeable enough to give advice on that.

They might be able to get you in sooner with their referral. \n\nThere are many different versions of Buddhism, but the main tenants I\u2019ve found in a lot of them are: The Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Path, and The Three Jewels of Buddhism (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha). \n\nIf you\u2019re like me and like to dive right in, I\u2019d recommend starting with learning about the Four Noble Truths. Those four points address suffering and offer a path (Eightfold Path) to follow. I can recommend some texts/books for you to read or you can just start by googling the Four Noble Truths or even just exploring them on Wiki. \n\nAlso, there are basically two types of meditation. Concentrative meditation and Contemplative meditation. Concentration meditation is used to train the mind in focusing and one-pointedness, which is meant to help you experience the process of focusing on your breath and not getting completely attached to all the thoughts in your head. It\u2019s like watching the clouds (your thoughts) float in the sky as they arise, come to fruition and then dissipate. The second form is Contemplative meditation and its when you examine the world, or yourself, or whatever thought/object you want to examine intellectually. \n\nWhen I was in your spot, hope was a valuable thing. Although Buddhism might not be a \u201cquick fix\u201d it can give someone hope that there is a way to evolve and grow and even use your depression in a constructive way. Just know that you are not alone and many people have walked, and are walking, that path with you. Don\u2019t lose hope, because sometimes that is the only thing that gives comfort. \n\nThe nature of the universe is change. In one respect that is difficult because we want to grasp some moments and make them last forever, but nothing stays the same.

Pa\u1e47\u1e0dakas\nAt one time a certain pa\u1e47\u1e0daka had gone forth as a monk. He went to the young monks and said, \u201cCome, Venerables, have sex with me.\u201d\n\n>The monks dismissed him, \u201cGo away, pa\u1e47\u1e0daka. We don\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\n>He went to the big and fat novices, said the same thing, and got the same response. He then went to the elephant keepers and horse keepers and once again said the same thing. And they had sex with him.\n\n>They complained and criticized him, \u201cThese Sakyan monastics are pa\u1e47\u1e0dakas. And those who are not have sex with them. None of them is celibate.\u201d\n\n>The monks heard their complaints. They told the Buddha.\n\n>\u201cA pa\u1e47\u1e0daka should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, they should be expelled.\n\nThere's some recent paper discussing on what pandaka should mean. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-meaning-of-pa-aka-in-light-of-the-vedic-and-jain-scriptures/12894\n\nI didn't read them, you're welcome to enjoy the read. \n\nBhante akaliko there is a gay monk. I met him just a few days ago, quite nice guy. \n\nSo here's the politics of the situation. \n\nThere's the progressive, very left leaning liberal side of Theravada culture which are quite dominating in the sutta central. And in reddit for Buddhism in general. Anyone even appearing anti LGBT here in Buddhism will get down voted a lot. \n\nThen there's the conservative part of Theravada who really just straight forward says pandaka is obviously meaning male attracted to male, including bi then. And a straight forward reading of the vinaya rules says no way, not allowed to be monastic. Gender reverse the pandaka definition for females then. \n\nGenerally, Theravada is mostly conservative, after all we don't acknowledge later Mahayana texts, and says that it's better to stick to what the historical Buddha said, rather than to see the spirit of it and rely on later authors who might get transmission from the next Buddha or nagajurna getting sutras from Naga's palace. \n\nSo you'll see that a lot of Theravada monasteries would not consider gay people as suitable to become monk. \n\nI dunno the sentiments amongst Mahayana, but they should have roughly the same vinaya rules as us. \n\nNow onto the progressive part, some teachers like ajahn brahm took the risk of ordaining gays as monks. It might be more challenging for them, but still, the practice is celibacy. And ajahn brahm is one of my respected teacher (going to join in his retreat next month, staying with him in person! Not the same room lah, but eat together! So cool). I just made a new friend in Bhante akaliko, you can join in sutta central forum to get in touch with him there too. \n\nSo, it's still a tricky issue within the Theravada community. Most people are too busy talking about Bhikkuni ordination to pay this LGBT as monks issue serious attention.",

They have left the Six Realms of Samsara in their training. \n\nThe first seven stages of Bodhisattvahood (out of 10/52 Stages, depending on which schema you use) is equivalent to the Four Fruits of Arhatship in relation to their ability to destroy defilements (Duan Fan Nao Kung Fu). \n\nAfter all, how can you help others (effectively) when you yourself are still stuck in Samsara?\n\nI see that the reason for perpetuating this idea is because the Sravakayana does not mention what happens to Enlightened Beings after they die, other than they definitely don't come back because they have ended the causes of Samsaric Rebirth (Three Poisons).\n\nSo using this as the base, they think the Bodhisattva must keep the Three Poisons to continue their work in Samsara. \n\nThey do not accept that a Bodhisattva can actually be Enlightened, end the Three Poisons and still come back (Pu Sa Zhai Lai) to aid sentient beings.

That person is already a hermit, has the Jh\u0101nas, supernormal powers, etc. He is capable of attaining to arahanthood if he wishes to listen to the dhamma. But he chooses to become a Buddha instead and thus in this sense delayed enlightenment. And most importantly, got the prediction from the living Buddha that he will become a Buddha so far far far long into the future where he trains in the 10 perfections. Only in the final life just before enlightenment did the wisdom faculty matured enough to breakthrough ignorance and obtain Buddhahood. \n\nNote that in this Theravada version, there's no need apparently to cultivate Bodhicitta from life to life, just most importantly is when meeting with a living Buddha with all the conditions above and more besides. 8 conditions in all. However, one could speculate that to cultivate Bodhicitta for many lives is one way for one to remember to arise the wish to become Buddha when meeting with a living Buddha. Or else become arahant, no chance already, but still liberated and good. \n\nThe above is Theravada, with support from suttas such as Buddhavamsa, J\u0101taka introduction (commentaries) and commentaries. \n\nEarly Buddhism is not a school, so there are many views on how Buddha arises according to different monks. \n\nSome say maybe Buddha was a stream winner from previous Buddha, so he got reborn back into human realm when there's no more dhamma. This is shown to be false by sutta which the Buddha explicitly referred to himself in his final life, before Buddhahood as an unenlightened Bodhisatta. By the way, this is also the main reason why Theravada do not accept the Mahayana notion that Bodhisattvas are enlightened before Buddhahood. \n\nSome others just say that like private Buddhas who can appear now and then, a fully enlightened Buddha is just a Buddha who decided to teach, or else automatically become private Buddha.",

The shravaka teachings are from the point of view of an arhat. Mahayana is the point of view of a bodhisattva. Vajrayana is the point of view of a mahasiddha. Dzogchen is the point of view of a buddha. Each level gets more sophisticated and less dualistic. They get more to the point, with more sophisticated practices. But it also gets challenging and more risky. People vary in terms of what vehicle or school they connect with.\n\nThen there's actual realization, as distinct from view. A Vajrayanist may be a long way from attaining the realization of shravaka path. A Theravadin may have the realization of a mahasiddha. *The vehicle is not the destination.* From Theravada point of view, you'll never complete a trip from NYC to LA if you don't proceed step by step in a straight line. Theravadins often look at Mahayana/Vajrayana and see a reckless driver who's going off-track, because they don't understand the Mahayana teachings. Mahayanists look at Theravadins and think, \"Why drive a car to LA when you can fly?\" \n\nHopefully they both make it to LA, or at least make some progress in the right direction. But that's really about practice, right? Whether you drive or fly, you need to actually make the trip. There's a famous story about that in Tibetan Buddhism: The mahasiddha Milarepa was seeing off his senior student and heir, Gampopa, who was going on retreat. They wouldn't meet again. Mila walked for a ways with Gampopa, then said goodbye. After a few minutes, Mila called him back, saying he had one last, special teaching to confer before parting ways. Gampopa got excited. \"Finally the old man is going to give me the good stuff!\" Milarepa then lifted his robe and turned around, to show Gampopa his grotesquely calloused ass from years of meditating in caves and sitting on stones because he couldn't be bothered to be concerned with comfort. His final, special teaching was basically, \"Don't forget, practice is the thing.\"",

This may come as a surprise to some as some Theravadins don't even consider Mahayana to be the teachings of the Buddha.  \n**I decided to ask Ajahn Achalo, via e-mail, if, according to Ajahn Anan, the pure land of the Buddha Amitabha did exist or not. He responded and said that Ajahn Anan had said that this pure land does in fact exist and that if one recites the mantra of Amitabha throughout ones life, one's perceptions may very well turn to that realm at the time of death.**\n\nAjahn Anan [website](https://watmarpjan.org/en/): \n\nI am just putting it here for reference.",

Stream entry in Mahayana, for example, is 1st bhumi, which is not available in Theravada. It's the sudden realization of non-dual awareness. I don't know why, but the two schools seem to invite confusion by using the same terms for different things. Buddhahood, then, is like a waxing moon that starts from 1st bhumi.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism generally, jhana practice is discouraged. It's considered unnecessary and potentially addictive. Form and formless god realms are still in samsara. Zen and Tibetan have three notable differences in comparison with Theravada. First is that both introduce various extra practices, such as koan practice in Zen and tantra in Tibetan. Second is that they both stress sampannakrama or \"formless meditation\". Other practices such as shamatha are done as basic mind training, but not with the aim of attaining accomplishemt of shamatha mind control or jhana states. Third is that they're lineages of realization. Sutras are rarely read. The guru is the buddha who's here and can speak to you in your culture/language. Modern buddhas are not regarded as less than the historical Buddha. So the direct enlightened teaching of your own teacher is more important than the historical writings. As a result, there's a lot of experiential teaching about the actual nature of enlightenment. I've mainly read my own teacher and varius great Tibetan teachers.\n\nDzogchen is what's known as fruition view. View of a buddha. It's heavily oriented toward the teaching of buddha nature, which Theravada doesn't recognize. Zen has similar elements. The idea is that awake buddha mind was never not there. You can't make or become buddha. You can't manufacture omniscience. You are buddha and always were. So the trick is to discover pure nondual awareness and acclimate to that until one eventually arrives at buddhahood. Dzogchen uses analogies like the sun behind clouds. There's no correlate in Theravada. Due to the view it's considered both powerful and tricky. Lots of New Age people have heard about \"just be here now and you're all set\". But it doesn't work, because egoic attachment is still operating. I think that's where the importance of shravaka path comes in. Without the discipline of meditation and ethical behavior, there's no basis for recognizing wisdom.\n\nThere's no reason you need to know about any of this if you connect with Theravada, but you also don't need to dismiss it. It's a different path.",

Come, Kalamas, do not rely on oral tradition, or on the lineage of teachers, or on holy scriptures, or on abstract logic. Do not place blind trust in impressive personalities or in venerated gurus, but examine the issue for yourselves. When you know for yourselves that something is unwholesome and harmful, then you should reject it. And when you know for yourselves that something is wholesome and beneficial, then you should accept it and put it into practice.\n\nI think AN 3.65, probably sums up what should be done as a Buddhist practitioner.\n\nFurther, Buddha called his dhamma **ehipassiko**, which means \"Come and see for yourself.\"\n\nas further explained [here](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel433.html):\n\n>He invites inquirers to investigate his teaching, to examine it in the light of their own reason and intelligence, and to gain confirmation of its truth for themselves. The Dhamma is said to be paccattam veditabbo vi\u00f1\u00f1uhi, \"to be personally understood by the wise,\" and this requires intelligence and sustained inquiry.\n\nIMO, It's best for Buddhist practitioners to study and investigate for themselves if the teaching is correct before they are passing judgement based solely on their intellectual understanding or hearsay.\n\nand if it's indeed beyond their capability to understand them, they can put them on hold and wait until they develop a capability to understand them.

Though thus beings immeasurable, innumerable, and unlimited are emancipated, there are in reality no beings that are ever emancipated. Why, Subhuti? If a Bodhisattva retains the thought of an ego, a person, a being, or a soul, he is no more a Bodhisattva.\n\nBasically, Bodhisattvas train themselves in the realization that, in reality, there is no such thing as a sentient being. It may sound nihilistic, which is why we use the term \"Great Middle Way\" to avoid extremes. We realize while there is some appearance, this appearance is devoid of any inherent nature. Often, the rainbow metaphor is used: \"It is there, but it is not really there.\" Both relative aspects (\"there\") and absolute (\"not there\") are equally important.

Take for example the various individuals who are held to be tulkus of Dudjom Lingpa. Dudjom Lingpa is held to have attained Buddhahood! However, he has tulkus, because they are his nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101yas! The word tulku is literally the Tibetan word for nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya.\n\nIf you don't know what a nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya is, then again, you seriously need to read a basic textbook on Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist doctrines.\n\nFor those tulkus who aren't held to be nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101yas of Buddhas, they are held to be part of the activity of bodhisattvas on the bh\u016bmis, who either are still reborn ordinarily (hence why they are here again) or undergo the inconceivable seeming rebirth as described in the \u015ar\u012bmaladev\u012b and other s\u016btras. But never is it believed in Tibetan Buddhism that such individuals refrain from attaining Buddhahood. In fact, the *opposite* is believed, as in the case of Dudjom Lingpa.\n\n>I know you're passionate about this, but you're also not right. It's literally in the definitions of both words, in which you can go read right now to get a better understanding of what they mean. \n\nI went and looked up the definition just to see what you were talking about and literally found \"In Buddhism, a bodhisattva or bodhisatva is a person who is on the path towards bodhi ('awakening') or Buddhahood.\"\n\nBut also, you should not trust random internet definitions in any case.
