The way I visualize that scene in my mind is that sishupal keeps saying curses, krishna listens calmly while sitting on his throne, eyes closed. the moment sishupal crosses the threshold, krishna's eyes turn lightening blue, sudarshan chakra appears in his right index finger, the atmosphere of the sky above the court changes to that of a thunderstorm with lots of lightening strikes, then we focus on one particular man present in the audience, completely scared of what his happening in front of him, he focuses on krishna's eyes and sees a scene where Kalki is slaying adharmis on his majestic white horse, two giant spears in his hands, we move back to the current scene and sishupal's head is gone, the atmosphere of the court returns back to normal",

Kali is the absolutely terrifying form of the primordial mother that no child of hers wants to see. She is Adishakti in her shantaroopa. That is the loving mother, the shakti that nurtures & is present in every being. \n\n\n>Maa Kali certainly is a fierce goddess capable of immense destruction.\n\nAre you talking about the primordial mother who is Power itself, or some mere material weapon of mass destruction? Kali is destruction itself. She is iconographically depicted with a terrifying appearance, clothed in nothing but skeletons & body parts of humans. \n\nThere's a reason why Shakti is depicted in various different forms. Each form represents the state of Shakti or power. But most Hindus are unthinking ones who don't think about these things. For them devotion only matters, knowledge doesn't. Such kind become preys of the missionary mafia.\n\n>This artist did a fantastic job. Who are you to say that's not Kali? \n\nIndeed, she did a beautiful artwork, but that's not Kali. Kali isn't supposed to be depicted like a cute smiling dark-elf girl. Ancient Hindus knew better. Google ancient sculptures of Chamunda. That is how Kali is supposed to look like. Not the modern post-Ravivarma type of depiction. \n\nMost Hindus think modern depiction as same as the ancient ones. But that's not true. Say for example, the modern depiction of Durga is multi-armed clothed in large exquisite saree & slaying a huge bodied asura with her trishula. But the ancient depiction of Durga is a multi armed grand form of the primordial mother clothed in the traditional battle-friendly ancient Indian attire with some ornaments & slaying the tiny asura with a small trishula that looks like a pen.

First of all:\n\n>Kali is the absolutely terrifying form of the primordial mother that *no child of hers wants to see.*\n\nSpeak for yourself.\n\n>Kali is destruction itself.\n\nAs I've said before, Kali is *time* itself, both creation and destruction. Both birth *and* death. You are reducing Her to merely the destructive qualities of time and forgetting that time is the very reason you exist.\n\n>But most Hindus are unthinking ones who don't think about these things. For them devotion only matters, knowledge doesn't.\n\nDo you think I don't seek knowledge? There's a reason I selected Kali above any other form of Adi Shakti. Any Kali worshipper is *fully* aware of the reality of Her destructive qualities. We have eyes. We can clearly see the garland of human heads, the skirt made of arms, and the severed head She is holding. We know what that's supposed to represent.\n\nWhat we see in Her that you're not seeing is the motherly qualities. Think of the tigress with her cubs. The tigress is powerful, ferocious, and dangerous - yet also kind and nurturing. She does what she does to feed her cubs. You cannot deny that the tigress is beautiful and elegant, even while acknowledging her fearsome nature.\n\nThat is how we view Maa Kali. She is not *just* destruction, but also creation. Time is creation. Time is destruction. Time gives birth, time nurtures, time causes death and suffering. Kali devotees understand that She is *all* of these things. Time is the cause of *everything* in our universe. That is why we worship Kali as the ultimate form of Adi Shakti.\n\n>Kali isn't supposed to be depicted like a cute smiling dark-elf girl.\n\nAnd then it comes down to this. You are greatly exaggerating how the artist depicted Kali. I see no smiles here. I see Kali's rage depicted to the left of the drawing. I see Kali depicted as beautiful, yes, but I'm not offended by that. I'm more perplexed by your assertion that Kali is *supposed* to be depicted a certain way. I'm fully aware of Chamunda. That is one way to depict Kali if you're going for a form representing pestilence, old age, and death. Certainly one significant aspect of Kali. But most Kali worshippers recognize that She is so much more than that. She is *time itself* and Mother to us all.\n\nIt seems like you have a hangup about how gods are depicted in the modern age. Why is that? What's wrong with Ravi Varma's depictions? What did the wise ancient Hindus get right that we decadent modern people have forgotten?",

Most of the Hindu deities are mostly metaphorical representations of something naturally occurring. Like Indra (The Lord of Senses (Indriyas), which is supposed to be the I), Agni (Fire/Heat), Prithvi (Earth, or one who holds us), Aranyani (Forest), Samudra (Ocean), Ganga (River/Freshwater), Lakshmi (Wealth), Sharada (Knowledge), Vishnu (Life), Surya (Sun), Apsaras & Gandharvas (Our material desires who should serve the senses (Indriyas) but not control us).",

Shiva & Shakti, or Purusha & Prakriti are both needed for life in this universe. Both are equivalent, but not the same in this Ishwaric satya. Both are distinct, but both are dependant on one another. Without Kala, Kali doesn't exist, without Kali, Kala doesn't exist.

Kali is everything & other gods are false. That's not Dharma. Kali is an aspect of that Primordial Brahman. But Kali is depicted in such a manner to give a message. You need to think what that is. \n\n>What did the wise ancient Hindus get right that we decadent modern people have forgotten?\n\nPlenty. The ancients had the knowledge of the why, what & how. For modern era Hindus, most of the Devi Devatas are akin to Comic book characters who are being worshipped. Not thinking of the why, what & how. The iconography by the ancients were clear regarding what these Devatas actually are. But modern depictions are of inferior grade & very much human-like. Over that modern day depictions impose their post colonial moralities over the deities as well. It's evident when you see the sculptures & paintings. By doing so, somewhere, the message in the deities' depiction is lost.",

This is what I hate about modern day Hindus.\n\nYou are defensive & aggressive thanks to pure faith, whereas I'm guided by logic, iconography & scriptures. Kali is the destructive form of Prakrti. Period. These are forms representing a certain something that normal devotees cannot decipher. Mookambika is the loving mother form of Adishakti. Mookambika & Kali, both are Adishakti herself. Just like how Mahakala & Dakshinamurthi are forms of Shiva himself.",

Because of their magic and powers they are now probably why they are popular in TuluNadu. There are atleast 500 Bhutas based on the household( read kingdom), farmland or forest. These actually live in the mentioned places only. Most famous ones are Panjurli, Guliga, Mantradevate,Pilichandi, Maisandaya, Koragajja, Jumadi, Lakkesiri, Koti Chennayya etc. Their stories usually are told by the womenfolk of impersonator or impersonator themselves in the form of songs or poem called Pardanas (Padddanas anglicised word).\n\nPanjurli's story is that once Parvati was making Ganesha on the mud and then some Panji or Boars along with their babies started playing in those. She got angry and complained Shiva about this and Shiva hunted a boar baby down. After a point of time, Parvati felt sad about  it and asked her husband to bring it back to life. Shiva brought back boar baby to life and gave it unlimited powers. Thus, the boar baby or Panji Kuruli became Panjurli.",

They started debating. It was going the same way Shankaracharya was winning the arguments. Then Ubhay Bharti ( wife ) cleverly debated on a sexual or a household topic , Shankarachrya had no answer to this because he never had any experience of married life. At this point Shankarachya agreed he is defeated. \n\nThis tells a lot about the wonderful culture we had. There can be no exception when one is challenging others on a debate, if someone has chosen the path of knowledge he should have all the knowledge and not ignore a type knowlege just because they are not istrested in. \nLater The couple or Madan Mishra only became the disciple of Shankarcharya and went with him.

He wrote many pieces and literature dedicated to shiv ji. Shiv ji was impressed (prassan) \n\nLater sometime an illiterate and poor man Ugna knocks on Vidyapati's door , he asks Vidyapati if he could work as a cook or helper in the house to do all household chores. Vidyapati's financial condition was not very good he declined Ugna's request. To which Ugna added that he will work for free he just wanted 2 meals a day thats it. To this Vidyapati's wife opportunistically said yes.\n\nEverything was going well Ugna was a average helper but completely dedicated. One day the king summoned Vidyapati , he was on his way to the Darbaar with Ugna. There was a jungle in between the palace and his house, after the walk they both took vidyapati was completely exhausted they halted in between in the jungle. Thirsty Vidyapati was looking for water all around but the jungle was very dry and he failed to find the water, he then asked his helper Ugna to fetch him water otherwise he'll die of thirst. Ugna grabbed the lota and went inside the jungle. Ugna then cautiously came into his original Shiv ji's form and open his hairlocks and filled the lota (sort of mug) with holy Ganga water. He came back quickly to Vidya pati as gods cant see their bhakt suffer for long. Vidyapati started drinking water , as soon as he took the first sip the water tasted like Gangajal but they were very far from the river and the taste of Ganga jal was so divine and pleasant he understood this is not just any normal person. \nHe asked Ugma to come to hi real form but he didnt came then he asked shiv ji please come to your real form i want your Darshan then Shiv ji came into his form and gave darshan. Shivji told Vidyapati he will be staying longer with him but he should not tell anyone about who he was it should be kept a secret , Vidya pati agreed. \n \nSometime later Vidyapati's Wife Sushila asked Ugna to do chore/work he didnt do it properly or did some mistake , she was angry on whatever ugna did. She went to the kitchen grabbed a burning wooden stick from chulha and started beating Ugna with it. There were thunder and clouds (aasman phat raha tha ).It is said that shivji didnt retaliate or runaway because he wanted to stay with his bhakt Vidyapati( this makes me emotional ). Hearing some noise Vidyapati comes out ,he sees his wife hitting Shivji with burning stick and shivji silently taking it because he wants to stay longer with him. Now Vidyapati is full of tears , he says ( verbatim) \"tu kekra maar rahal chiye , u saakshaat Shiv ji chi\" \" who do think you are hitting he is shiv ji himself \" \nAs soon as he said this Ugna dissapeared.\nTheir pact was broken. Vidyapati literally lost his mind he went everywhere to search for Ugna but he couldnt find him in the village , jungle, anywhere.\nHe was in too much sorrow that he couldnt handle, seeing Vidyapati's helplessness Ugma appeared in front of him. \nUgna said that he can no longer stay with him but he will be in form of Shivling.

Meru to the heavens. Along the way all the brothers and his wife die before reaching Swarga (heaven), for various reasons, and Yudhistira eulogizes them by lamenting the key moral flaw that led to their deaths, such as vanity for Arjuna or Draupadi being too attached to one of her husbands over the others.\n\nIn the end Yudhistira summits the mountain alone, save for a mangy dog that had accompanied him and his company along the whole journey. When he gets there Indra greets him and basically says \"Congrats! The heavenly abode awaits, just leave the dog and come on in.\" Yudhistira asks about the dog and he is told dogs aren't allowed in heaven, but this is Yudhistira's last chance. If he turns it down now he goes to Naraka (hell).\n\nYudhistira refuses and says that the dog has been a loyal and devoted follower to him, and it is his duty to return that devotion. He would be accursed and dishonorable to turn it away to fend for itself now. At this point the dog reveals himself to be Yamaraj, the God of Death and divine arbiter of righteous conduct. He reassures Yudhistira that this was merely a test and he passed.\n\nIn a way, I read this as Yudhistira basically scolding Indra. The Kurukshetra war was horrible and led to a great deal of suffering and loss of life. Both the Pandavas and the Kauravas had many righteous and devoted people among them, yet they all suffered and died, with little to no help from Indra or any of the Devas to head off the conflict. Yudhistira carried the burden of guilt for these events throughout his life and we can, perhaps, assume he may have been somewhat bitter towards these powerful Devas and Devitas for allowing things to come to this. When he says he cannot simply abandon his devoted follower to suffering and starvation in his absence, that he has a duty to nurture it in return for the devotion it gave him, it's hard not to read this as an indirect critique of the Devas for ignoring the suffering in the world in spite of the offerings and devotion offered to them.",

He is both Sakala and Niskala (formless/Nirguna).\u00a0It is in his Niskala aspect that the Linga is appropriate as it represents his formless aspect.\n\nFurthermore, great authorities in the faith have said that attributing the linga to be a phallus is incorrect and harmful for spiritual practice.\n\n>The popular belief is that the Siva Lingam represents the phallus or the virile organ, the emblem of the generative power or principle in nature. This is not only a serious mistake, but also a grave blunder. In the post-Vedic period, the Linga became symbolical of the generative power of the Lord Siva. Linga is the differentiating mark. It is certainly not the sex-mark. \r\n\n>Linga means \u2018mark\u2019, in Sanskrit. It is a symbol which points to an inference. When you see a big flood in a river, you infer that there had been heavy rains the previous day. When you see smoke, you infer that there is fire. This vast world of countless forms is a Linga of the Omnipotent Lord. The Siva Linga is a symbol of Lord Siva. When you look at the Linga, your mind is at once elevated and you begin to think of the Lord.\n\n~Swami Sivananda\n\nThe Shankaracharya of Puri himself has said that it does not refer to a phallus but instead is a symbol of his as Swami Sivananda explains.\n\n[The meaning of 'Linga' in 'Shiva linga'](https://youtu.be/kWdyrWBLdKU)\n\n[Turn captions on]\n\nThere's a stick(danda) which monks carry, it is called the 'Vishnu Linga,' in what way does a stick represent a phallus. When both scripture and gurus-acharyas say that it refers to his nirguna aspect and is a symbol of that, we have no reason to assume otherwise. The prescence of a few lingams shaped like the phallus does nothing to prove it being a phallus in the face of substantial evidence like this.",

                "content": "Today's culture considers explicit showing of body an act of immorality. Morality is decided by the era, it's cultural and philosophy that is followed by its people. \n\nThe phallus is source of energy. In the female aspect, it is representative of fertility. This is very much of importance in early societies where the population was still small and agriculture in primitive stages. Fertility is still a good thing today. We pray for good crops and healthy children. If you hear of experiences of 60-70 years ago, you will be astounded by the high infant mortality rates. Today, it has improved. The credit for it goes to science which provides a new view of God.\n\nThe view of God changes with society, yet if you believe in one God, it remains the same in the core of it. \n\nThe reason for why phallic representation is seen as immoral, or in biblical terms, sinful can be ascertained via the experiences of the society in last 100-400 years (& even before). In general, a turbulent (war torn) society does not provide much for leisure or pleasure. In such, the gods are different, the position of women is different, the needs and requirement are different. Whereas in prosperous society (peaceful and free), people can turn towards pleasures (& even vanity) freely. It leads to development of the finer arts and pleasureful tastes. (Also, there is often a mix of both too.)\n\nLingam is a very old concept. Its continuation is preservation of the ideas it represents. However, there is more to say about the fact that it is viewed as a sexual symbol and not a representative one by the people. It says a lot about the mentality of today's people themselves. They are not to be blamed or praised for the thought. It is simply what persists in them today. \n\nOne more thing, we create our gods in the view of the society we live in. For example, Jesus has different skin tone, aesthetic, in different regions of the globe. Similarly, different cultures in India paint or sculpt their gods differently. From the accounts of Marco Polo in Malabar, the men and women their did not wear more than a loin cloth. However, they were fond of ornaments and jewelry and wore a good number of them.\n\nThis is also reflected in the different clothes, skin shades (blue-black), and features we see in the varied depictions of Gods throughout India. One can also think upon the fact that different places in India had different Gods and with times, they spread throughout the subcontinent fairly evenly (for a good number).",

Having seen him, the wives of the rsis were fascinated; noticing this, the rsis cursed Sankara, saying: \"Your linga shall fall\". Exactly this happened, but once the linga fell to the earth it burst into flames and its heat began to incinerate the world. In the end, Parvati fixed it within her yoni and all the rsis and gods worshipped it. **__Here, the yoni and the linga are the divine prakrti and the supreme purusa. It would be a great offence to consider linga and yoni that are forms of Siva-Sakti, as merely the worldly penis and vulva, the fleshy organs of urination.__**\n\n>Thereafter the story is told of the sivalinga which, having fallen down due to the curse of the munis, became like a raging fire and, roaming the earth, heavens and hells (patala), bringing great distress to all the worlds. Brahma then said:\n\n>\"Supplicate Girija (Parvati). Only she can bear this linga of supreme radiance, in her form of the yoni.\"\n\n>All the gods and munis began to pray; this pleased the Lord and Girij\u0101, and so in the end Siva was installed within Girija. **__Could an ordinary linga be able to roam the various worlds, and having fallen burst into flames? And would Visnu, & all the gods and munis worship a mere worldly linga or yoni?__** And even were this be so, what would be the need for Krsna to go to Upamanyu for initiation to do tapas?\n\n>**__Some people say that the aforementioned sivalinga of the story is just the universe (brahm\u00e2nda); holding it in his hand(He compares this to Lord Krishna showing Ma Yashoda the universe in his mouth), God had gone to perform Leela__** in the forest of Daruka where, by the curse of the munis, this linga fell out of his grasp. **__For this reason it is said that 'it fell down' and not that it was cut down'__**. **Prakrti, made up of the fivetold elements (pa\u00f1catatvatmaka), is the yoni**, the support for the brilliant energy of the Absolute, this linga of light. Therefore, **to say that Parvati took the shape of a yoni to hold the linga means that, becoming prakrti-in the form of the five elements she supported the Universe. Could a worldly yoni, a urinary organ, a scrap of leather, support the jyotirlinga, made of fire, that burns everything?**\n\n>In the world it is heard that Parvati, the beloved of Shiva, is of the form of an arrow.\n\n>The meaning of the form of the yoni is the same as that of the form of the arrow. The word 'arrow' (bana) is indicative of the number five: it is applied with regards to Kamadeva, by reason of his five arrows; when addressed towards Shiva, it regards his five faces and when to **__Parvati, the perspective is her nature comprised of by the five elements(Parvati in her Saguna aspect is Prakriti/Shakti, which consists of the 5 'mahabhoot'/ great elements). Just as a mass of energy (vidyut pu\u00f1ja)  pervades the five elements, yet is more predominant within water and in mountain ranges, similarly did Parvati become arrow-shaped(of the form of something made of the 5 elements), that is of the form of a mountain range, and into her the effulgent linga (tejomaya linga) entered.__** If the mass of divine splendour were to fall into her yoni that is, into earth or water it would become stable; otherwise, it would reduce trees, men and everything else to ashes.\n\n>**__Therefore, it is ignorance to say that, in these and other passages of the Scriptures, the word yoni denotes the urinary organ.__** The linga supported by the Yoni, worshipped even by \u015ari Visnu, the pre-eminent God of gods, cannot be said to be a mundane object.\"\n\n~['The Linga & The Great Goddess' - Swami Karpatri Maharaj](https://archive.org/details/410253613-the-linga-and-the-great-goddess-swami-karapatriji-maharaj-pdf_20220520/page/n47/mode/1up?view=theater) (pg 95-110)\n\n\n\nFinally, as Brahmadeva says in the Saurapurana:-\n\n>\u201cThat form of Mah\u0101deva which is Unmanifest (avvakta) is called\u00a0li\u1e45ga; it is bliss (\u0101nanda) and beyond all nescience (tamasa\u1e25 para\u1e43).

So cats in fact do not posses elevated divinity compared to say cows or deers. \n\nInterestingly, violence against cats is strictly prohibited in Hinduism. Although most strands of Hinduism advise against harming all animals, harming a cat is especially taboo to an extent that one's actions mustn't even result in the cat losing a strand of their fur.

It was a pleasant few days. A lot of late-night functions from \"Sundar-Kaand\"(5th book from Ramayana) to \"Bhajan-kirtan\". Children, adult, and old folks had their fair share of enjoyment. \n\nToday was the 'Bhandara'(food offering) and it went really well. I, myself, took part in serving the food to people, I was late for the said Job, but once I was there, I didn't even realised where 3:30 hrs went, lol. We fed easily over 3000 people from the entire colony and people of nearby Societies.

Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. \n\nIn terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).\n\nLastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can do this for all 3 faiths and it is still accepted and encouraged in Hinduism, so go ahead and do it.\n\nAlso maybe try reading both the Bhagavad-Gita and the Guru Granth Sahib, I think both are excellent books that you can find online for free.\n\nI am glad you are re-exploring your roots while also questioning things, questioning can be very important too, and wish you all the best.

The Vedas were written here, amongst many other events of cultural and religious significance. Unfortunately many people attribute the Punjabi identity, culture, language, food, etc to Sikhs. However that simply isn't the case. Sikhi was created some 500 years ago and all these facets factually predate this time frame. That being said, my ancestors have been residing in Punjab, what is today Jalandhar (named after the slain demon) since Rigvedic times. To put it into perspective, the Jatts (many whom converted to Sikhi) migrated to Punjab from Rajasthan and Gujarat in the 11th-13th century. I think the fact that you're exploring Hinduism despite being raised Muslim is a feat in and of itself. Once you're conditioned to believe one way growing up it's definitely hard to break that. Not to mention, once you become disillusioned with one faith it can be hard to see any reason to study another. Kudos to you! Keep us updated on your progress and any tidbits you learn.

I cannot possibly see how it can be justified.\n\n>That's what many invaders prayed on\n\nExactly and that is something I hate. It was being taken advantage of. \n\nRemember, you are Punjabi. You can go back to your roots of Hinduism and Sikhism which are more suited to your needs of inclusivity.",

That being said, it's not surprising at all that a story which was first orally passed down thousands of years ago has changed with time, and to me the fact that there are many regional varieties with different interpolations is proof of how engaged people have been with the Mahabharat and how people have liked to interact with the story for so long. \n\nUnfortunately it is not possible to go back in time and receive the Mahabharat from Vyas himself. \n\nThere are other interpolations that people are less passionate about than those having to do with Karna's story. I just read a book where Buddhadeva Bose talks about some slokas where Bheem praises Krishna and gives his biography to Yudhishthir just before Shishupal is killed, and Bose says these slokas are absent from the Bengali version but apparently present in a Southern version.

However, this female hair-dress was not used by women every day and at every time. It was worn on special occasions like marriage or at the time of going out. \u015a\u016bdraka notes that a married woman was expected to put on a veil while moving in the public. This may indicate that it was not necessary for unmarried females to put on a veil.[15]\n\n>\tIn M\u1e5bcchakatika, courtesan Vasantasena's mother, having received ornaments for her daughter from a wealthy suitor to keep her as his mistress, she sends Vasantasena with her maid, asks her to go in the carriage bedecked with ornaments and to put on her avagunthana veil. This instruction is taken to signify that a courtesan who has accepted a suitor, had to use a veil in public similar to married women.[16] At the end of the play when Vasanthasena is legally wedded, she receives the title \"Vadh\u016b\u015babda\" meaning \"title of a bride\" simultaneously with the veil \"vasantasen\u0101m avagunthya\" meaning \"a token of honorable marriage\".[17] In the same literature, courtesans' maid servant Madanika marries her lover Sarvilaka, a thief who changes his ways. Her new husband says to her that she has achieved what is difficult to acquire: \"Vadh\u016b\u015babda avagunthanam\" meaning \"the title and veil of a bride\".[18]\n\n>\tIn the Pratim\u0101n\u0101taka, a play by Bh\u0101sa (3 - 4 CE) describes in context of the Avagunthana cloak-veil that \"ladies may be seen without any blame [for the parties concerned] in a religious session, in marriage festivities, during a calamity and in a forest\".[19] The same sentiment is more generically expressed in N\u0101g\u0101nanda and Priyadar\u015bik\u0101 by Harsha, where maidens were expected to wear no veil; it was donned only after the marriage.[20] Later, the veil was referred to by the same term, avagunthana, in \u015ai\u015bup\u0101lavadha and the Dashakumaracharita.[21] According to commentator Sankara, the ladies of Sthanvisvara used to go about covering their faces with a veil.[22]\n\n>\tIn Buddhist Mahayana literature, Lalitavistara S\u016btra, young bride Yasodhar\u0101 objected to observe veiling (oguntheti/ogu\u1e47thik\u0101) in front of respected elders. This was taken to be a sign of immodesty and willfulness, as people criticized her and gossiped.[23] When she became aware of this, Yasodhar\u0101 came before the assembled court and defended herself in a long statement: \"Those whose thoughts have no cover, no shame or decorum or any virtue, those who gossip, may cover themselves with a thousand garments, yet they walk the earth naked. But those who veil their minds, control their senses, and have no thought for any other except their husband, why should they veil their faces?\" Yasodhar\u0101's parents-in-law were delighted with their daughter-in-law's proud statement and gave her two white garments covered with jewels.[24]\n\n>\tIn Valmiki's Ramayana dated between the 5th century BCE to the 3rd century CE, Prince Rama asks his wife Sita to unveil herself so that the gathered citizens of Ayodhya can take a look at them before they go in exile to the forest; there is no mention of Sita veiling herself again after this incident.[27] At the end of the epic, hearing the news of Ravana's death, his queens giving up to lamentations rush outside without their Avagunthana, in which chief queen Mandodari surrounding his corpse says \"Why do you not get angry, beholding me, having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city gate? Do you behold your wives who have thrown off their veils. Why are you not angry seeing them all come out of the city?\"[28] Thus, it is notable that royal women avoided public gaze and veiling was expected to be worn only by married women.[29]\n\n>\tIn Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntalam by K\u0101lid\u0101sa, written between the 3rd and 4th century CE, when the heroine arrives at King Duhsanta's palace, seeking to take up her wifely status, the king first remarks \"K\u0101 svid avagunthanavati\" meaning \"who is this veiled one?\" and immediately forbears to look at her, with the words \"Anirvarnaniyam parakalatram\" meaning \"The wife of another is not to be inspected.\"[30] This largely indicates that Avagunthana was a sign of a respectable married woman, and was a married woman's raiment.[31]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoonghat#History",

                "content": "The depicted of the Vedic people and of the Deity is very inaccurate. This is a Quora post I came across awhile ago as to why Indian art depicts people as Caucasian: \n\n**Why do medieval Hindu paintings tend to portray deities as dark-skinned, but modern day Hindu paintings almost always portray deities as light-skinned?**\n\nBecause the colorist preference for light skin over dark skin has significantly increased throughout the Indian subcontinent since medieval times, caused mainly by British colonialism. Certainly colonialism did not originate this prejudice, but it strengthened it considerably.\n\nThe portrayal of Gods as far more light-skinned in modern-day Hindu paintings was pioneered by one man, Raja Ravi Varma, who studied European art in the mid-1800s and introduced its beauty standards, including fair skin, into Indian art. This won him acclaim as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. Many called him the \u201cfirst modern Indian painter\u201d, ignoring the thousands of other Indian painters practicing their traditional art forms; what they meant, of course, was the first Indian painter to heavily incorporate European art styles and sensibilities.\n\nSo popular were Raja Ravi Varma\u2019s paintings of Hindu Gods that they became the gold standard, so to speak. A large majority of paintings of Hindu Gods made since then have largely followed his template, including the light skin, even for some Gods explicitly described as dark-skinned in all scriptures and folk traditions and who were portrayed as dark-skinned in art prior to this time. See this modern image of Krishna, a famously dark God, which literally portrays Him as inhumanly white - it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nOne of the other major influences was the Amar Chitra Katha comic books, which a huge number of Hindu children (myself included) grew up on. I still love them and have a large collection of them, but it\u2019s undeniable that they are extremely colorist, almost without exception - good characters are drawn with essentially Caucasian skin, while bad characters are dark, pretty much 100% of the time.\n\nAccording to the scriptures themselves, Hindu Gods come in a dazzling variety of colors, from dark to light to blue to red to green to golden, to even yellow with blue stripes! This variety is rarely portrayed accurately in modern art.",

It is situated about 13 kilometers south-east of Tirupati city. Though Gudimallam is a small village, it is well known because it has a very early linga that is unmistakably phallic in shape, with a full-length standing relief figure of Shiva on the front.

She complained to Kashyapa about it and asked for help.\n\nKashyapa said: \"There is a vrata by name PAYOVRATA. Brahma once taught\nme this vrata. In the month of Phalguna, from the first to the twelfth day of the\nbrighter fortnight, you should worship Narayana day and night with only milk as\nyour food. Recite the mantra with the twelve letters: the great Dvadashanama:\n\"AUM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA.\" If you observe this vrata with\nintense devotion and concentration the Lord will grant your wishes.\"\n\nAditi performed the Payovrata. Her mind was stilled and her senses were kept\nunder control: her thoughts were all lost in the feet of Narayana. At the end of\ntwelve days the Lord appeared before her.\n\nThe Lord looked kindly at her with lotus eyes and said: \"Mother of gods, you do\nnot have to tell me what is paining you. I know that your sons are at the mercy of\nthe asuras. You want to see your sons back in power. I know that. All that will\ncome to pass. But you have to wait. The time is not yet ripe for it. At the\nmoment Bali's star is in the ascent because he has Sukra as his guru as also\nSukra's disciples. The glory of Sukra is such that his protege, Bali, will not come\nto harm.\n\nHowever, I am pleased with your Vrata and I will grant you your wish. I will be\nborn as your son and then I will be able to help your sons. Do not breathe a word\nof this to any one since my birth will have to be a devarahasya.\" The Lord then\nvanished from her sight. Kashyapa, with his yogic power knew what was to\nhappen. He was happy because his wife was happy.\n\nA son was born to Aditi. When the child was born it had the form of the Lord as\nAditi had seen it: as though he wanted to assure her that it was, indeed He, who\nhad been born as her son in accordance with his promise to her. A moment later\nhe assumed the form of a child and there was great rejoicing in the three worlds.\n\nThe child grew up to be a boy. He was small made and he was indeed a\nVAMANA. When the time came Upanayana was performed for him. Surya\nhimself taught him the Gayatri. Brihaspati, the preceptor of the gods gave him\nthe sacred thread and Kashyapa gave him the Maunji. The earth gave him the\nKrishnajina: deer-skin. The moon gave him the brahmin's staff: the Brahma\ndanda. Aditi gave him the Kaupina and the Dyurloka world gave him the\numbrella. Brahma who held the Vedas inside him gave him the Kamandalu and\nthe seven great rishis gave him the bundle of Kusa grass. Sarasvati gave him the\nakshamala.  Kubera granted him the vessel with which to collect his alms. Parvati, the\nconsort of Mahadeva who goes by the name Annapurna, gave the child Vamana\nhis first Bhiksha. Vamana's other name was UPENDRA.\n\n###BALI'S YAJNA\nOn the holy grounds of Bhrigukachchha the asura monarch Bali was performing\nthe Ashvamedha under the direct guidance of Sukra and his Bhrigu clan. Vamana\ndecided to go there and attend the yaga. Bhrigukachchha was on the northern\nbanks of the sacred river Narmada.\n\nThe yaga was proceeding and suddenly there seemed to be a great glow\nemanating from somewhere. When they all looked around, it seemed to be\ncoming towards them. They all paused and spoke to themselves: \"It seems as\nthough the rising sun is walking towards us.\" They all looked at the tiny little\nbrahmin child walking towards them with the kamandalu in one hand and the\numbrella in the other.\n     \nVamana walked into the\nyajnashala. His tiny chest covered by the maunji, with the sacred thread glowing\nlike a streak of lightning across his chest, with his head covered by a charming\nJata, with the kamandalu in one hand and the umbrella in the other, the tiny\nyoung brahmin stood there. The entire assembly stood up as one man: so great\nwas the glory of the boy who was hardly a child. Bali rushed to his presence, fell\nat his feet, honoured him and offered him a noble seat. He washed the tiny feet\nof the young brahmin and placed the water on his head. He then said: \"Welcome\nto you, my lord. I do not know who you are: but this I know. You have come\nhere to bless me and to grace this yajnashala.\nTell me what I can give you.\nDo you want the earth? or gold? or houses? Shall I give you beautiful maidens or\nshall I give you horses or elephants or cows? Please command me and honour\nme by accepting a gift from me.\"\n\nThe small young brahmin smiled very sweetly on Bali and said: \"It is but right\nthat you should speak these words which are so full of humility, nobility and\nrighteousness. It is not, however, surprising that it should be so. The great Sukra\nand the Bhrigus are your acharyas. And, as for your ancestors, your grandfather\nwas the great Prahlada! your father, Virochana who was famed for giving.\n\nBorn as you are,\nin such illustrious family, is it a wonder that you are so righteous? I will certainly\nask a boon of you. I know you will grant me that. I WANT FROM YOU THREE\nPACES OF GROUND MEASURED BY MY FOOT.\"\n\nBali was amazed and he stood speechless for a moment. Then, with a tender\nsmile lighting up his face he said: \"Indeed, you are a child. You spoke words of\nwisdom and they please the wise. Nevertheless, I am afraid you are still a child.\nYou have pleased me with your\ncharming words and yet, instead of asking me for whole islands and heaps of\ngold, you ask me for three paces of ground measured by these tiny feet! Once I\ngive there will be no need for you to desire anything more at any time. Revise\nyour words and take from me land large enough to keep you in comfort through\nlife. Come, ask me.\"\n\nVamana said: \"I appreciate your words and your generous gesture, O king,\nbelieve me, if a man has not conquered desire, all the desirable things in the\nworlds will not be enough to satisfy him. A man who is not satisfied with three\npaces of ground will not find the seven islands with all their wealth enough to\nsatisfy him.  It is this discontent which is the cause of sorrow in man. \nI therefore ask you to grant me\njust this: three paces of ground which will be covered by my foot.\"\n\nBali laughed again. Smiling indulgently he said: \"So be it. I will grant you three\npaces of ground measured with your Tiny Foot\"; and he looked at the tiny lotus\nfeet of the Lord in the form of a Vamana.\nWith the smile hovering still on his lips Bali took up the vessel full of water to\npour a few drops of it on the lotus palm of the youngster and say: \"I have given\nyou what you asked for.\"\n\nstory continued below due to length restrictions.",

                "content": "###\"DO NOT GIVE\", SAYS SUKRA\n\nSukra the preceptor stopped him. Without speaking a word the king lifted his\neyes and there was a questioning look on his face. Sukra was the wisest of the\nwise men. He was known by the name \u2018Kavi'. There were some who said that he\nwas wiser than even Brihaspati, the preceptor of Indra. Sukra loved the Daityas\nand Bali was his favoured disciple. He did not want Bali to be deceived. \n\nHe looked kindly at the king and said: \"My son, you do not know what you are\ndoing. This sweet young brahmin boy who, according to you is still a child who\ndoes not know what is good for him' is not what you think he is. He is the Lord\nNarayana himself.\nThis Narayana who is standing before you is going to deprive you of all your\nwealth. You will lose all that you have!\"\n\nBali listened to his guru with great attention, but decided to proceed anyway.\n\nBali and his wife sat at the feet of Vamana and washed his dear feet and took the\nwater on their heads. The heavens rained flowers on Bali and his wife\nVindhyavali. The sky was filled with the music from heavenly instruments. The\ngandharvas began to dance and the kinnaras were singing. Flowers were falling\non Bali incessantly.\n\n###\"THREE PACES OF GROUND\"\nThe gift had been given and received. Bali lifted his eyes and looked at Vamana.\nEven as he was looking the small brahmin boy grew to immense proportions.\nBali looked with tears of joy at the Vishvarupa of Narayana. He was granted the\nprivilege of seeing the form of the Virat Purusha.\n\nThe immense form of the Lord reached the heavens. Narayana, with one foot\ncovered the earth which belonged to Bali: his frame filled the skies and his arms\nspread wide, enveloped the quarters. For the second pace only a part of the\nheavens was visible. He raised his foot and it reached the maharloka: and\npassing it, it went to Janaloka, Satyaloka and Dyurloka. Brahma, who was in\nSatyaloka went with great excitement near the foot of the Lord. The gleam from\nthe nails was like the soft light of the moon and it beautified the Satyaloka. With\nhim came the rishis Marichi; the Sanaka brothers: the yogis, the Vedas and their\nbranches and they all worshipped the foot of the Lord. Brahma performed puja\nto the foot of the Lord with the water from his Kamandalu and the water which\nfell from it to the Foot of the Lord flowed as a river by name \"MANDAKINI\"\npurifying all the spots she touched. On the earth, when she was brought there\nlater, she became known as Ganga.\n\nThe Lord had measured the entire earth and the heavens too. He resumed the\nform of the Vamana and stood there smiling. The asuras saw their master robbed\nof all his wealth and his kingdom. They decided to fight with Vamana. They\nthought that they could fight with Vamana: destroy him and re-establish Bali on\nthe throne.\nBali became angry with\nhis attendants. He said: \"Listen to my words and abandon this resolve to fight.\nEvidently, the time is not favourable to us. Indeed, Time is the most powerful of\nall factors. Time is the Lord himself and according to Him and His wish man is\ngranted happiness and sorrow. Man is helpless in His presence. There was a time\nwhen this same Time favoured us and it spelt ill for the Devas. We were\npowerful and they were suffering. Time has now decided to reverse His tactics.\nNothing, not a large army, nor incantations nor tapas can stem the tide of Time.\nWe can only wait for the moment when there is a change in our fortunes. Till\nthen, be wise and control yourselves. Do not fight. It is futile.\"\n\nGaruda was standing by the side of the Lord. He stole one glance at his master\nand then, with Varuna Pasha he tied up Bali. There were shouts of horror and\nindignation from all quarters when this happened.\n\nBali smiled to himself. He knew why this happened. Narayana wanted him to be\nrid of the two dread sins which had found a place in his heart: the twins \"I\" and\n\"MINE\". When he had said, \"I can give the entire earth to you. It is mine,\" the\nLord must have smiled to himself and decided to punish him for that. He looked\nat Vamana. When he saw the love and grace there, Bali knew that he was wrong.\nThe Lord had come to bless him. By asking the boon he had taken away all that\nhe had and the sin \"MINE\" had been washed away. The Lord now wanted to let\nthe world know that only by surrender can one lose \"I\" and that was why he had\nasked Garuda to bind him. The kindness of the Lord made Bali's eyes fill with\ntears and he bowed his head with humility while he was being tied up with the\nVaruna Pasha by Garuda.",

And Narayana said: \"You are the king of the\nasuras and you promised me ground which will be covered by three paces\nmeasured by my foot. Two of them, as you have seen, have been covered and\nthey are mine. There is still one pace left. Where will I place my foot? Tell me.\nYou have not kept your word and you know what the punishment is, for one who\nspeaks an untruth. You will have to be pushed into the nether world. Your guru\nhas already told you about it.\"\n\nBali was neither frightened not hurt by the words of Vamana. He smiled and\nsaid: \"Lord, I do not consider my words to be lies. There is still place for your\nthird pace. Please be gracious enough to place your foot on my head.\"\n\nAt that moment Prahlada, the grandfather of Bali, came. He was the beloved\nBhakta of Narayana and Bali wanted to fall at his feet and honour him but he\ncould not, since he was bound by the Varuna Pasha. He welcomed him and\nworshipped him with his tears. Prahlada went straight to Vamana and fell at his\nfeet. With his tears he washed the feet of the Lord. Brahma came to Narayana\nand said: \n\n\"This Bali has given away everything\nto you and he has surrendered himself to you. He should be rewarded by you.\"\n\nNarayana said: \"When I want to destroy a man I grant him all the wealth and\npower in the world. He then gets involved in them and forgets his real nature. If,\nhowever, I desire to save a man from this Maya, I take away his wealth, his all.\nRid of all his faults, he will become mine. Once he is saved, my bhakta will\nnever be destroyed.\n\n\"As for Bali, never once has he swerved from the path of truth. He has\nconquered Maya.\nBali has now attained a state which is to be envied by the devas.\nBlessed by me, he will be the Indra during the Manvantara by name SAVARNI.\nHe will stay till that time in Sutala which is dear to me. Bali, king of men, you\nwill now go to Sutala. I will be there with you to protect you. I will always be\nwith you. All your asuric nature will vanish very soon and you will be a great\nIndra during Savarni Manvantara.\"\n\nBali was released from the Varuna Pasha. He walked round the Lord, Rudra and\nBrahma. He then entered the Sutalaloka. Prahlada spoke to the Lord. He said:\n\"The denizens of the heavens prostrate at your feet for your blessings. As for my\ngrandson and me, we are not devas. We are mere asuras. By birth we are inferior\nto the devas. And yet, your love for us is great: so great that I consider that our\nfortune is far greater than theirs. How can I thank you, Lord, for the kindness\nyou have showered on this child of mine? You had made him Indra. When there\nwas danger of his forgetting himself because of the splendour of it, you have\ncome yourself, taken his glory away from him and blessed him. And you have\npromised to be the guardian of Bali in Sutalaloka. I do not know what we have\ndone to deserve this favour from you.\"\n\nVamana smiled kindly at him and said: \"Prahlada, please enter the Sutalaloka\nand stay with your grandson. I will always be there in your presence. Mace in\nhand, I will guard the portals of your house.\"\n\nPrahlada then entered the Sutalaloka after saluting all the gods. At the command\nof the Lord Sukra completed the yajna which had been begun by Bali.\n\n\nThank you for reading.",

If we look at atheism in places besides when it is officially state imposed by totalitarians, the most atheistic societies are the safest, most equal, best educated, healthiest etc. This is like Nordic states, Japan, tiny rich micro nations like Monaco. The reason atheist or agnostic populations are higher in these places with better living conditions is because of the very human failures of organized religion and its often cruel and nonsensical dogmas. With that, we can see, as time progresses, a growing population in these secular & formerly Christian societies are rediscovering the potentially healthier, pre-Abrahamic religions of their ancestors. \n\nSome people may choose to say that atheism is better because we cannot know for sure and it leads to an emphasis on humanism and altruism in free societies, because for atheists, this is the only world and life they\u2019ve got, and that, relative to religious societies or society based on originally religious values & now wearing secular robes but trying to keep the religiously-derived bits, has worked much better for people, the animals, and the earth/Bhumi herself. \n\nI agree with your point about humbleness being something we\u2019re losing as our egos become massive and asuric, but I don\u2019t think this relates to the the discussion on dualism & non-dualism. In my experience dualism seems to lend it self to tribalism and nationalism and ego gigantism as well. The actual arguments between dvaita and advaita are headaching-ly intricate too and I\u2019m not very familiar but, do you think the advaita schools are coming from a place of ego? I think that they are, just as the dvaita philosopher are, very well read people who are open minded to the possibilities of their being wrong. If I was born before science and maths had become so advanced, I wouldn\u2019t have learned the physics and cosmogony that has led me to lean towards advaita being the reality-describing school, but perhaps in the future AI and other things may lead to revelations or technology that lead me to lean towards Dvaita description of reality. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really topical to mention, but I have a question: Which texts have you read from & which do you recommend for a newcomer like myself to gain a good understanding of this discussion? I was recently surprised when reading Vishnu Purana. I thought it would be more dualist but actually it seems to be repeatedly stating that the entire universe is Vishnu, and that people who focus on Jagganath and keep him in their hearts constantly, especially during intensely difficult moments, can actually become so filled with Achyuta that they awaken Govinda fully within their mortal shells. This is confusing to me but very cool too. Perhaps I am misreading a lot. What do you think?",

He has never read any scriptures and talks all pseudoscience and wastes people 's time, effort , money and life.  He has copied his yoga programs from another guru called Rishi Prabhakar and doesn't give credit at all. Arrogant, egoistic and easily triggered person who claims himself to be god.\n\nThere are lot of bad things to his name.\nHere is a writeup on with proofs i posted in spirituality page, read and explore more about it yourself :\n\nGlad that you brought this up in an international subreddit. \nIt's very true about the feeling one gets when we hear him talk. It's full of ego, hypocrisy with regards to his own speeches & concepts, and trying to shun people down when right questions are asked. \n\nAlso, a hell lot of pseudoscience stuff he brings in with no backing at all (when researched also , whatever he says doesn't come out to be true) which is very misleading to the confused youth/youngsters who don't go about factchecking or thinking on their own what one says makes sense or not. \n\nI am a local of Coimbatore who has known his activities for the several years. My friends and Family members once have listened to him, attained some sessions at the ashram and then realised many things from then to now on. So very careful read below and do your own research and thinking:\n\nTo tell about his history, a police FIR (first information report) has been filed on him by his Father in law claiming he has doubts on why and how his wife was cremated so soon before he could he his daughter and Sadguru should have killed him, because it is not customary for their community to burn a body rather bury only. Sadhguru in his own speech when asked, said that, she reached 'mahasamadhi' i.e killed herself by meditating on her own will. Now come on, doesn't it ring a bell on the absurdity? Ok, so why not any other soul from that time onwards till now in the ashram hasn't attained the same state yet? Why didn't he kill himself by the same way liberating from the world? Why would only his wife who has a young daughter by that time will kill herself? \nIt is also said that he has extra marital affair with another lady and hence he and his wife got separated a year before the wife (viji is her name) was murdered.  Sadhguru claimed to do some tri-energy consecration on the dyanalinga statue in the ashram using the third feminine partner (now come on, seriously?)  \nHere is the link to detailed article with FIR and newspaper article\n [https://sadhgurukilledhiswife.wordpress.com/](https://sadhgurukilledhiswife.wordpress.com/)\n\nAbove shady background being said, he misguides and fools people a lot with claims that he knows everything which is very dangerous for people like : \n\nTelling people that only 3 to 4 hours sleep is enough while doing his meditation while forcing people to do his practices (simplified yoga asanas + meditation) twice and day nearly upto 6 hours (in his residential programmes at ashram and otherwise too). Getting unpaid volunteer help from young people who are gullible. Come on, he has somehow used the people to work on his projects for marketing for longer hours for him, Whereas science and we know we need good amount of sleep (6 to 8hours) to function very well. \n\nClaims two meal a day is enough. Claims meat is bad but fish is ok to eat (hypocrisy here too).\n\nClaiming with gimmicks like rudraksha mala will rotate clockwise if food is good energy if not anticlockwise of the good has gained inertia . He does it my slightly playing with his fingers holding the mala. So gross & sad to see how obviously he fools people:\n [https://youtu.be/_L50ikT5LEw](https://youtu.be/_L50ikT5LEw)\n\nSomehow Brainwashing people to maintain celibacy and refrain from marriage and successful relationships. I know people who have left marriage and good relationship to follow his misguided spiritual path and join as full time volunteers/disciples in the ashram. Thus by luring more People into doing work for him without payments as his volunteers.\n\nAlso very importantly, local and Indian goverment bodies have time and again issued letters for illegal construction of several buildings in the ashram over the elephant corridor and protected places without permission from the authorities, including notice for demolition of all the buildings. But in India corruption is still very high, and with his power and money he has evaded all. Till now more than 120 elephants have died in the region due to change in their habitat and path they take.\n See link for all the government letters and notices and know for yourself: \n\n[how isha empire was built illegally ](https://www.newslaundry.com/amp/story/2021%2F05%2F17%2Fhow-sadhguru-built-his-isha-empire-illegally)\n\nAlso, he evades from paying taxes because in India if the money is received as donations by a registered trust or non-profit organization (which isha is), tax is exempted under  80G clause of Indian tax laws. So, he sells his courses and services, products and mostly doesn't give bill/check but rather a receipt for donation which clearly not the buyer is giving on the first place. \n\nThere are many more shady things happen. In India people like him somehow had good relationship with politicians who are themselves criminals and they have symbiotic relationship with each other and hence he has not been taken down. Also, religion is a touch taboo in India and people get away using religion as shield and inherent fear. \n\nThings are very dirty , what he does and says. \nNo truth, no research proofs and lot of business happens. \nLot of misguided youths especially who are wasting their precious years by listening to his false claims, rather than doing something productive or worthwhile in the name of spirituality.",

People that have only heard others' opinions (and sometimes lies) try to judge someone like a Guru or Mystic.  If what a guru says doesn't resonate with you, move on.  If it does, get to know more about them, get initiated by them, and see what happens.\n\nI have been initiated into several practices by Sadhguru and it has changed my life in so many ways.  I have had a lot of serious health problems disappear, and my entire way of thinking has changed in a way that the depression and anxiety I suffered from for 40 years left me.\n\nI am a very logical type of person.  I have worked in science for years, and have papers published in some prestigious journals.  I am not the type to be fooled or hoodwinked.  I listened to some of Sadhguru's videos on Youtube and what he said made sense to me, so I tried some of the free practices offered online, and then took a few programs offered by Sadhguru.  I do the practices daily and it has made these changes in me as well as many others.  My life is better as are the lives of millions around the world.\n\nYou don't have to believe anything he says.  If you feel like trying of something he offers great.  If you don't that is fine too.\n\nas far as the conspiracies that people are bringing up, they have e been disproven over and over again.  Some people seem to like negative rumors over proven facts.  It gives them something to get obsessed over instead of taking a good look at themselves.  It is a self-defense mechanism for some of them.  In the long run, they harm themselves and others though.  Seems to be a shame to me.",

Just because he has regular multiple videos doesn't mean he is working 24 hours. You don't monitor him 24 seven, you don't know what he eats, drinks, drugs, pleasure, sleeping etc.  Any YouTube influencer puts Vlog everyday does it say they are serving humanity? It's their bread and butter to survive on fame and celebrity status, hence the image/illusion created by videos.\n\u2022 yeah, in the videos its his trick or smile when he contemplates his answer. He most times easily gets triggered and can see him easily frustrated, disappointed. Just because one smiles few minutes in the videos, that too cunningly, it doesn't mean anything. He is smiling for the camera is on, most of the times\n\u2022Thats 300 kms a day, no way near an average 500 to 600 kms actual bike riders. I myself a bike rider. And only for video recording he rides a little a day (maybe not even 50 kms). Then he goes into his comfort caravan, similar to actors,then attends the events for marketing. Any con-man has his stupid group to attend.\n\u2022 where , what millions? Don't throw random numbers. Million YouTube views means million people got entertained, not enlightened. Several YouTube entertainment reaches million views.\n\u2022 They apply themselves to come to talk, and when he talks people get he is a funny guy and not to be taken seriously. \n\u2022 Just because he himself applied and came to few IIMs and IITs does mean anything, since he still talked non-sense. And that's why he was not called again there. Moreover all the questions were sent to him already and only specific people can ask him questions. He cannot answer a real intellectual question, be it from anyone.\n\u2022 there are several videos on YouTube it's debunked. Search for keywords with Sadhguru fraud and scams. \nAlso, real scientists are doing their actual job, they don't earn their livelihood by coming in media. They do actual research. Go talk to a doctor or scientist about his claims, they will see you and him as retards.\n\u2022 Gullible people. And again where is this random 'millions' number mumbo jumbo coming from? Don't talk like your cult leader without any basis. Initiation and shit stuff. Occult names for mislead things. I have been to dhyanalinga and bhairavi stuff there at isha(new product he released with his marketing) and i don't feel anything rather pity for the mislead young people there as disciples and monks who have no clue of anything sensible. Local people/visitors see all this as madness, and crazy asylum. \n\u2022Again for fame and celebrity status. There was nothing achieved in his scam campaigns. He cheated people and scammed people here very outrightly. The Waterman of India openly said it's a scam and doesn't support it, where he looted people. His scheme doesn't work or make sense, as indicated by the real experts.",

It is true he is trying to reach out to as many people as he can in the world.  Unfortunately, that does take some money.  He never states that his teachings are the only way to achieve Mukti.  Those that really can't afford it are given scholarships or offered free classes.  For example, he gives free initiations to tribals and those in prisons.  He also has a fair amount of free practices available on YouTube, the website, and the Sadhguru app.\n\nIn addition, many people in our modern societies don't normally really respect things being given to them for free.  If it involves a practice that you have to do daily to reap results, they will take the free program and forget about it in a week.  If they have to pay for the course, they are more likely to dedicate enough time to practice it to actually see the benefits in it.  I think it shows an understanding of modern thinking.  I admit that I make less money than the average person.  I have had to make sacrifices to take some of the programs that I have taken, but I don't regret it.\n\nAgain, I'm not necessarily recommending that everyone run off and take any program.  If you find something that resonates with you and want to take it, give it a try, and make it happen.  If it doesn't resonate with you, move on and find something that does.  Sadhguru isn't for everyone and there are many other ways to achieve the same goals.  I just know what is working for me and making my life better.",

Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the Truth.\"\n\nBasically, you don't have an approachable Guru, so the reverence and rendering service unto him is far from reality.\n\nHonest question, Have you actually met Sadguru in person, sat with him personally and asked questions, and received answers? I am saying were you in a group, was there a 1-on-1 without paying first? If not, he is not \"your\" guru.\n\nI have heard stories on how these gurus actually charge an amount to meet someone or even for group concerts that they conduct on Shivarathri, you need to book the spot.\n\nIn Vedic culture, Guru Dakshina was popular, but it was always paid with due respect, only after you have learned the knowledge from your guru. Not there was a time in the past, you would have to do an advance booking and advance payment, that happens only with a business, not with spirituality.\n\nAnd don't forget to do \"Samvada\" (Inquire, dialogue, or discussion) with your teacher (Guru), for that you need to be capable enough to ask the right questions to get the answers, if it satisfies your hunger for knowledge and understanding, you can call anyone as your Guru. If you have never had a \"Samvada\" with your so-called guru, the problem is either with you or your guru, either you have no understanding or hunger for higher knowledge, or you do not have an easily accessible Guru, in other words, you don't have a guru.\n\nAll that's happening with these \"gurus\" is that you do not get to \"learn\", or \"inquire\", but the 3rd part of rendering service is happening very neatly. That's not how you should choose a guru.\n\nJust because someone has \"guru\" in their name, they don't become \"your\" guru, they just have the name \"guru\", not an actual guru.\n\nJust my $10 advice for you, that is how much time I took to consolidate this comment to help you.

My Guru belongs to Sringeri Lineage. We don't do Vishnu vs Rudra vs Devi games. So, Sankhya, Yoga, and Core-Tantric philosophies are out in our scope. So, Sadhguru for us was just a new-age fancy guru. I also joined ISKCON when I came to the US (but left).\n\nUnknowingly my ego started evaluating gurus, because people like Sadhguru was getting more recognition than my gurus. Soon realized that Mother Bharati gave birth to many prominent people and diverse branches of literature. So, before you take my word for it, do check out the Vedic and Agamic translations ([LINK 1](http://sanatanadhara.com) and [LINK 2](http://namahshivaya.net)) if you get time.\n\nFinally, long story short a retired purohit from Tirumala (our Ista Divam) told my friend to get out of our egos. For the first time, I took up Yoga Sutras and Vasistha Yoga literature, booked a flight, and finished a residency. So today silly me. Sadhguru is a game player, he is like a bus driver who only brings kids to school, not a teacher. He is not the teacher of Vedic Shakha. He is a siddhi, a Trantric who is not going to publish his Guru order. He is bringing Youth who left Sanatana culture back using Yoga and Samskriti programs. Only for a few people, he teaches Tantra Vidya after midnight. I only volunteer in his ecological efforts as they are very productive in the west. Still I have to pay for my Karma. Good day.",

So a young friend who is deep into tantra and yoga gave me a short and clear answer for this. If you are planning to do meditation, then your body, diet has to be ready for it. He gave the name of many people who ended up with serious issues mental and physical for improper practice. Many did Shambhavi without the preparatory steps and they all ended up with similar issues you said. When I was at their residency they narrated a story of a kid who did this and ended up in serious complications. They said and I quote \"without Surya Kriya, you are not fit for Shakti Chalana Kriya, without this you are not fit for Shunya\". If you open the Yoga Sutras book by IK Taimni, it clearly says, one has to achieve considerably in Asana and Pranayama putting both of these into Niyama. He says at least 4.5 hours in one asana. People these days with busy lifestyles want to jump into meditation. that is why Adi Shankara clearly said, for Advitam do not go into Pranayama and Meditation. He rather created panchayatana pooja vidhi for it.\n\n\\[But, it is not about how many hours you meditate, or how much siddhis you have, if you don't lose your ego, and don't self-inquite, you are totally heading in the wrong direction.\\] I agree with this totally.\n\n\\[Kids don't know that bus driver is not a teacher\\] you are taking this too literally. I used this example to state that, today's youth Millenials and GenX will not interpret the bhasya left by Acharyas. They cant even begin to read them for an hour. Forget about practice. The youth is so far gone into TicTok and Instagram that they think Karma is the name of a coffee shop in LA and Yoga means tight pants and a good body. To them, Sadhguru gives a watered-down approach of Yoga. As Sri Krishna said, \"even a little practice of spirituality is not lost, its carried over to the next life\". My work colleagues and many from our department are active performers of Isha Kriyas. They are doing really well in social and health. But its very difficult to give you a visual of what i experienced in a span of few years and how I ended up resenting my own childishness. Again I am not an active member of Isha, i only helped once for ecological causes. I still performed our Guru's laid-out sadhana in conjunction with Shambavi. I am however very keen to practicing Shakti-Chalana kriya and the Yoga's Shunya state of meditation.\n\nFinally, Sankhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta are not possible for current and next generations. At best few people will end up reading books online. Few might join some local programs. Only 0.00001% will go out in search of a guru and may find one. For the rest something has to be done, some repacking has to be done so that culture is preserved.    \nNice talking to you.",

Why because, the time he lived needed people to cherry pick few from Yoga darsnana and a few from Vedanda to keep themselves spiritual. After Vedic Era people moved towards Bhakti Agamas. It was Adi Shankara who merged 10 Vedic Schools + Sutras + Gita as one body of literature and Tantra Agama + Bhakti Hymns. Prominent people will come and create a \"new soup\" out of the same set of ingredients depending on time and people. Sadhguru is telling the Millennials and GenX that ecology is getting damaged because of their technology and also they are moving away from Yoga and Tantra. So he is just repacking it for them. But if you go his core Ashram, you will see crazy Fire Tantric rituals at 2am that are super scary.

Shiva goes and takes a divine bath and when he returns Meenakshi's mother calls him Sundarar or Sundareshwarar (Lord of sll beautiful things). The divine marriage of Meenakshi and Sundareshwarar is a big thing every year :) there are many stories or even how Vishnu as Azhagar wanted to come to the wedding and was crossing a nearby river when he hears the divine wedding music, he gets sad that he missed his sisters wedding, throws the gifts he brought into the river and returns. Meenakshi and Sundareshwarar then come apologize and get married again in front of Azhagar (also means beautiful man). \n\nThis is extremely condensed, she has many many stories and it is said if you believe and enter Madurai, you will see her and feel her presence.",

These 7 Rishis were extremely intelligent for they knew the consequences of inbreeding long before modern medicine today discovered it causes genetic defects. In order to avoid inbreeding within their own families, the concept of Gotra was introduced. Meaning that family members of each Rishis can marry off into another Rishis household bloodline and thus prevent inbreeding and its genetic consequences. This is Gotra in a nutshell. (Gotras today are named after the 7 Rishis) If you look outside of this concept then yes, inbreeding has produced genetically damaged humans. Hindus were advanced in all these knowledge and thus knew about what would happen if inbreeding occurred.",

Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. \n\nIn terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).\n\nLastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Looking at the Pashupati seal, it's clear that some form of Shaivism predates any Aryan migration,  which itself is disputed.\n\nBut let's get back to your argument. Perhaps it is your royal lineage from the island of Lemuria that gives you this sense of superiority, because while deciding my argument you have never confronted DMK's attitude towards Hinduism, Brahmanical or folk. Do you believe that DMK is pro \"Tamil\" Hinduism? \n\nAnd an honest question...what deity do YOU worship? Because looking at the state of Tamilnadu,  I don't understand how full of anti Brahmin hatred you have to be to deny the absolute vitriol being spread by churches. \n\n\nAnd to conclude,  you are trash. Absolute trash. My opinion on that remains unchanged. Dravidian nationalists are a special breed of morons following a literal incestous pedophile.",

                "content": "The colonialists and later the Western imperialists figured out ways to control and dominate other cultures by creating powerful narratives about them. They made sure that those narratives were pushed through the gateways of power - academia, research institutions, publications, media and politicians. The rest would take care of itself. That narrative gains \"authenticity\" through repetition that results when divided native populations go at each other using this narrative - one supporting it for its gain on power and the other opposing it. This way a small population from a Western country can dominate a much larger native population located far from their center. This divide between the natives tends to widen, providing room for the plunderers to move in from the dominant country and take all the resources away - educated people, talent, mineral wealth, products and so on. If any native tries to awaken their people about what is going on, the powerful countries deny them opportunities to rise, write atrocity literature on them, defame them worldwide and threaten the native governments regarding dire consequences that can result if they do not back off. This is a tested and tried method that has reached near perfection now. Just by using tentacles inside the target country and wiggling it periodically can ensure continued dominance over that country. No one will dare rise against them.\n\nToday one sees a lot of campaign raised about \"Brahminical Patriarchy\", Dalit oppression, caste dominance, Hindutva terror, Fascism and so on about India. They have cleverly mapped everything to align with their narratives.\n\nWhite majority - oppressed colored/black minority is a reality in Western countries that are running the imperialistic order across the world now. Even leftists across their nations fight against this oppression. Now they have cleverly mapped it to Hindu majority and non Hindu minority in India. So the minorities are oppressed and need help from the \"international community\". What they have cleverly hidden is that fact that numbers do not matter in dominating others. They themselves are an example of this (see the first paragraph). The real mapping to the Indian situation should be the native majority and colonial minority. We know who had all the power. It was so much power that I am writing this in their language. My countrymen will not mind their language as a link language, but will fight tooth and nail if the majority native language is proposed as an alternative. You can see the effect of narratives here.\n\nWhen the independence movement gained momentum across India, the imperialists cut that momentum by projecting Gandhi over the others and making him an apostle of peace in a world which was seeing world wars (European wars became world wars). Gandhi was not fully a Hindu in all aspects. He was influenced by the works of Leo Tolstoy and adopted non-violence and passive resistance as his method, which worked out well for the imperialists. The leftists in Western nations celebrated Gandhi so much that no one could touch him. The real freedom fighters (Bhagat Singh, Bose, Aurobindo et al) were hounded out and chased. The prisons they were put into were like Guantanamo bay, whereas Gandhi and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nehru were housed in comfortable settings with libraries, beds, free walks and so on. The independence movement was now divided between nationalists and liberal pacifists who were pro-Western in their outlook. Once the nationalists got desperate and began to align with the Nazis, that too was taken advantage of. The British indeed left India in a hurry because the nationalist army was gaining over them. But they projected all credit to the non violent struggle by Gandhi. In addition, once the nationalists were pushed away from the freedom movement, the British did further divide by propping up Jinnah and his demand for Muslim nation. They knew that these divides will work in the long run and it did.\n\nThe use of crooked cross by the Nazis was projected as the Aryan Hindu symbol of Swasika. Now that Hitler had committed horrors against the Jewish minority, the Swastika was projected as the symbol for the holocaust. Gandhi's assassination by Godse ended up working against the nationalists even more. When the nationalists slowly gained momentum across India over four decades, it was projected as a Hindu nationalist movement and the Swastika was associated with it, no matter how much people tried to explain to the Westerners that Nazis used crooked cross and not Swastika. Today the Hindu nationalist party is in power and is trying to build the nation and make it stronger. Had Godse not killed Gandhi and turned him into a martyr, this whole thing would have taken place four or five decades earlier. The imperialists won. But the BJP govt is making India gain slowly and a respectable country in the world. The imperial powers do not like this development.\n\nSo they are on an all out war colluding with Islamists, Missionaries, Communists, leftist elites and anti BJP parties, secessionist elements, India's enemy states and regional powers within India, along with their philanthropists, academic institutions, media, social media and think tanks on an all out offensive, projecting Hindus as the next Nazis, repeating the incorrect mapping of majority/minority, caste issues and trying to destabilize India from within. A backward India relying on their dole works good for them. If they refuse to abide by those rule based international order, they will face the same fate as African nations with nationalist leaders faced.\n\nBut India is different. They expected it to collapse and make Yugoslavia look like a picnic long ago. India has to hold its breath and keep striving to fight off these forces because the world is going to change. The imperialists are being emasculated now and will lose their power grip (which they called as globalization). Once the US dollar no longer is the world reserve currency, everything will flip. India has to tough it out till then.",

Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. \n\nIn terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).\n\nLastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They are deeply devoted towards Krishna and sometimes this deep devotion combined with some teachings of their gurus and human psychology tend to form this Superior-Inferior play. As a devotee, it might help them immensely by staying true to Krishna and leading a blissful devoted life but while interacting with others it tends to manifest as the superior-inferior ideology. Do not hate them for it. Nor like them for it. It just is.\n\nComing to dance, first of all you don't need to dance and sing but understand that dancing is one of the fundamental divine provisions for humans. Lord Shiva LOVES to dance. His cosmic dancing form known as Nataraja Swamy is one of the most prominent entities in Hinduism especially in South India. BUT that doesn't mean you have to dance. Understand its divinity. Same with singing and music. Now coming to yourself , you have internet my friend. You have access to loads and loads of knowledge through scriptures, speakers, videos, rituals etc. (But be aware of the premise that some knowledge might be wrong, fallible or misinformation just like other things on the web).\n\nJust say Om Namah Shivaya and delve right in. I'm on a similar path as you despite being a Hindu Indian but I am closer to MahaVishnu more. But that doesn't stop me from saying Om Namah Shivaya every time I wake up in the morning. \n\nHope this helps.\ud83d\ude4f",

You have the freedom do choose what you like in Hinduism. And you have choose Siva. But don't ever say one is inferior to the other. It is the mistake made by many but not all of the Hindus. Remember they're all One.\n\nHindus in India pray and interpret Gods according to the geographical locations.\n\nIn my Tamil culture Siva has wife Parvati (she many other names), elder son Ganesh, younger son Murugan (have many names too). Right hand man Nandhi the bull and few other helpers. \n\nLord Vishnu is the elder brother of Ma Parvati in one of their incarnations. (Siva's brother in law). There's a ten days festival celebrating this narrative in Madurai in Tamil Nadu overlapping April and May every year.\n\nIf you have difficulty in finding a guru pray to Siva asking for one. He will give you one. It maybe a little child, a teacher, a priest, a beggar, a gangster, your parents, some guy living down the street, a total stranger. Not necessarily a religious person.\n\nThe lord himself/herself may come as your guru in any form. Don't worry too much about a guru.\n\nYou can pray to Lord Siva in Portuguese too, there's no restrictions. You can be a vegetarian or a non vegetarian. It's up to you.\n\nI got stop here.

Here are some of my favorite bhajans dedicated to Lord Shiva: \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zah1WA4c38Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zah1WA4c38Q) \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8DCbYtTOkY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8DCbYtTOkY) \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xln-x\\_3WvJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xln-x_3WvJw)",

I understand the lack of a religious community can be frustrating if you want to find someone who shares your beliefs, but ultimately, religion is between you and God.

Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. \n\nIn terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).\n\nLastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
